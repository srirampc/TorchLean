  Formalizing Neural Networks in Lean
</h1>

TorchLean brings general tensor computations, machine learning, and mathematical proofs together
in Lean. We can use its shape-checked tensors for linear algebra and numerical algorithms, write
our own tensor functions, or build and train neural networks, from small examples to larger
GPU-backed training runs. Lean is both a functional programming language and a theorem prover,
so we can run a calculation and reason about it in the same language.

We reuse model definitions for training, graph transformations, certificate checks, and proofs.
The verification tools cover questions such as whether a classifier keeps its prediction across
an input region. Through FloatLib, we can choose the numerical precision and prove bounds on
rounding and numerical error under explicit assumptions. TorchLean owns automatic differentiation;
on GPU, it calls LibTorch's ATen operations to compute tensor values and local gradients. The
external GPU implementation remains a trust boundary, separate from the Lean proofs.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean.git
cd TorchLean
scripts/lake.sh exe cache get
scripts/lake.sh build
```

For Linux, macOS, Windows/WSL, CUDA with LibTorch, and an explanation of
TorchLean's backend architecture, see the [Installation guide](https://lean-dojo.github.io/TorchLean/installation/).

### Native Windows (MSYS2/UCRT64)

TorchLean builds on native Windows — CPU and optionally CUDA — through an
[MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) **UCRT64** shell.
Lake invokes `cc` directly, and the standard Lean for Windows toolchain does not put a `cc` on
`PATH`, so the build must run inside MSYS2 (which provides `gcc`/`cc`). Install MSYS2 and Elan
on Windows via Command Prompt or PowerShell, then from a **UCRT64** shell:

```bash
pacman -S --needed mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-gcc mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-clang mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-cmake mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-ninja
git clone https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean.git
cd TorchLean
lake exe cache get
lake build
```

The CUDA configuration builds the LibTorch backend natively (`cuda=true` implies LibTorch).
It requires an MSYS2 shell with the MSVC environment already initialized, i.e. an
MSYS2 shell from an environment where `vcvars64.bat` has already run (e.g. an
*x64 Native Tools Command Prompt*, launching `msys2_shell.cmd -ucrt64` from it), leaving
`INCLUDE` and `LIB` set and `cl.exe` on `PATH`. You also need the NVIDIA CUDA toolkit and a
CUDA-enabled LibTorch SDK. `-K cuda_home` and `-K msys2_lib_dir` are mandatory; `-K msvc_lib_dir`
is optional (derived from `cl.exe`'s location on `PATH`). `-K cuda_arch` is not used — the SDK's
CMake configuration supplies the supported GPU architectures:

```bash
lake -R -K cuda=true \
  -K cuda_home="C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v13.3" \
  -K msys2_lib_dir="C:\msys64\ucrt64\lib" \
  -K libtorch_home="C:\path\to\libtorch" \
  build
lake -R -K cuda=true \
  -K cuda_home="C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v13.3" \
  -K msys2_lib_dir="C:\msys64\ucrt64\lib" \
  -K libtorch_home="C:\path\to\libtorch" \
  exe torchlean quickstart_mlp --device cuda --steps 10
```

Pass every Windows path to `-K` with **backslashes** (`C:\path\to\libtorch`); MSYS2
mangles forward-slash arguments (`C:/path/...`).

At run time the CUDA toolkit `bin` directory (for `cudart64_*`, `cublas64_*`, `cufft64_*`) and the
LibTorch `lib` directory (for `torch.dll`, `torch_cpu.dll`, `torch_cuda.dll`, `c10.dll`,
`c10_cuda.dll`) must be on `PATH` (e.g. `C:\path\to\libtorch\lib`). WSL2 remains the
best-tested Windows route; see the Installation guide.

## Quickstart

```bash
scripts/lake.sh exe torchlean quickstart_mlp --device cpu --steps 10 --arithmetic ieee --execution eager
scripts/lake.sh exe torchlean quickstart_mlp --device cpu --steps 10 --execution eager

# Optional GPU run with a CUDA-enabled LibTorch SDK, matching toolkit, and NVIDIA GPU:
export TORCHLEAN_LIBTORCH_HOME=/absolute/path/to/libtorch
scripts/lake.sh -Kcuda=true build
scripts/lake.sh -Kcuda=true exe torchlean quickstart_mlp --device cuda --steps 10 --execution eager
```

The first quickstart uses [FloatLib](https://github.com/lean-dojo/FloatLib)'s binary32 arithmetic.
The second uses Lean's native `Float32`.
Typed tensors and models also accept other FloatLib binary formats; see [Precision](#precision).
The CUDA command uses LibTorch's GPU runtime while TorchLean retains its differentiation tape.
It reports an error when CUDA is unavailable.

Application code writes concrete tensor types as `Tensor α [dims...]`, with the element type first.
For example, `Tensor Float [4, 2]` is a four-by-two tensor of `Float` values:

```lean
import NN.API
open TorchLean
open Trainer.Objective (mse)

/-- A two-layer regression model. The dimensions are checked when the layers are composed. -/
def model :=
  nn.Sequential![
    nn.linear 2 8,
    nn.relu,
    nn.linear 8 1
  ]

-- Four input rows, each containing two features.
def xs : Tensor Float [4, 2] :=
  [[0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 1.0], [1.0, 0.0], [1.0, 1.0]]

-- One regression target for each input row.
def ys : Tensor Float [4, 1] :=
  [[0.2], [1.0], [1.0], [1.8]]

-- The leading `4` counts samples; each sample has shapes `[2]` and `[1]`.
def data : Trainer.Dataset [2] [1] := Data.fromTensors xs ys

def trainOnce : IO Unit := do
  -- Select the loss and train through a typed graph with FloatLib binary32 arithmetic.
  let trainer :=
    Trainer.new model
      { objective := mse
        optimizer := optim.sgd { learningRate := 0.05 }
        execution := typedGraph
        device := cpu
        arithmetic := ieee }
  -- Inspect the initialized model before any parameter updates.
  let initialPrediction ← trainer.predict ([0.5, -0.25] : Tensor Float [2])
  IO.println s!"initial={reprStr initialPrediction}"
  -- Each step averages 16 sample gradients at one parameter point, then updates once.
  -- Training returns a result that retains the updated parameters and run report.
  let trained ← trainer.train data { steps := 200, samplesPerStep := 16, logEvery := 25 }
  trained.printSummary
```

## Commands

```bash
scripts/lake.sh exe torchlean --help
scripts/lake.sh exe verify --help
scripts/lake.sh exe verify -- torchlean-ibp
```

For the maintained examples:

```bash
scripts/lake.sh build NNExamples
```

## Use TorchLean From Another Lean Project

TorchLean is a normal Lake package. You can depend on the Git repository directly:

```lean
require TorchLean from git "https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean.git" @ "main"
```

Then run from the downstream project's root, using its own Lake configuration:

```bash
lake update
lake exe cache get
lake build
```

Use `import NN.API` for model, data, and training code. It provides `TorchLean.nn`,
`TorchLean.Data`, `TorchLean.Trainer`, and `TorchLean.optim` without exposing the full proof and
backend trees. Use `NN.API.Verification` to call
`trained.verify center (radius := r)` after ordinary training. Explicit verifier
graph lowering has the focused import `NN.API.Verification.Lowering`. Use `import NN` when the
same file also needs proofs or backend infrastructure; focused imports such as `NN.GraphSpec`,
`NN.Runtime`, or `NN.Proofs` are available for subsystem work.

### Custom tensor computations

We can write a scalar calculation as an ordinary Lean function, apply it to a tensor, and choose
the execution device at the call site:

```lean
import NN.Kernel
open TorchLean

def square := fun (x : Float32) => x * x

def input : Tensor Float32 [3] := Tensor.ofFn fun i => Float32.ofNat (i.val + 1)
def onCpu : IO (Tensor Float32 [3]) := square.run input (device := cpu)
def onGpu : IO (Tensor Float32 [3]) := square.run input (device := gpu)

#eval square.run input (device := cpu)
-- [1.000000, 4.000000, 9.000000]
```

CPU runs the Lean function and is the default. GPU compiles supported calculations through NVRTC,
using native FP32/FP64 or configured binary arithmetic. A CPU-only scalar type or format retains
its precision on CPU with a diagnostic. Unsupported code for a GPU-capable type, or an unavailable
GPU, still returns an error. Functions can take runtime scalar parameters;
`f.zip left right` combines two equally shaped tensors. Indexed programs support bounded loops and
fixed-parameter numerical recurrences, with Lean-checked correspondence to the recursive equations.
Whole-tensor functions use the same call: `f.run input`. Add `(grad := true)` to record supported
operations on the existing autograd tape; the result has `.value` and `.backward`. Shapes and
storage are inferred from the input. Arbitrary indexed bodies are not differentiated automatically.
See the [custom-operation guide](NN/Kernel/README.md) for supported operations, indexed programs,
lowering proofs, and the native execution boundary.

### Precision

[FloatLib](https://github.com/lean-dojo/FloatLib) supplies configurable arithmetic and numerical
proofs. TorchLean's CPU tensors and typed models can use binary32, binary128, or a custom binary
format without converting through native floats. Custom GPU computations also accept configured
binary types, selecting compatible hardware operations automatically and using integer-limb
software arithmetic for custom formats and precisions beyond native floats.
The LibTorch tape retains binary32 for `Float32` and binary64 for `Float`, including gradients
and optimizer state. Configured binary arithmetic also records on the GPU tape, retaining complete
words for saved values and gradients. This supports the arithmetic operations described in the
[custom-operation guide](NN/Kernel/README.md#recording-a-calculation-for-differentiation);
native model operators and optimizer checkpoints still require native dtypes.
Decimal and posit formats use CPU.

See the [typed-training example](NN/Examples/Quickstart/TypedTraining.lean) for binary128 training
and the [tensor guide](https://lean-dojo.github.io/TorchLean/blueprint/Building-Models/Tensors-That-Remember-Their-Shapes/)
for precision, shapes, and derivatives. Import `NN.API.Precision` for the scalar integration, or
`FloatLib` for standalone numerical work.

## Proofs And Runtime Boundaries

TorchLean proves properties of explicit Lean definitions. It also checks certificates produced by
external tools, including bound-propagation and scientific-computing workflows. An executable
certificate check reports acceptance by that checker. A semantic guarantee additionally requires
the checker's soundness theorem and its hypotheses; a Lean proof needs kernel-checked evidence of
acceptance. None of these checks certifies the program that produced the certificate.

CPU instructions, CUDA kernels, cuBLAS, LibTorch, PyTorch, Julia, and other external systems are
runtime providers. Their interfaces, assumptions, and available checks are listed in
[`docs/TRUST_BOUNDARIES.md`](docs/TRUST_BOUNDARIES.md). Third-party sources and licenses are listed in
[`docs/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`](docs/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md), and
