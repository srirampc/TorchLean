# Installation

If you want to try TorchLean on a laptop, start with the CPU build. It does not require PyTorch,
CUDA, or a GPU. The repository pins its Lean version in `lean-toolchain`, so Elan will select the
right compiler for you: Lean 4.34.0. Mathlib uses the matching release. FloatLib tracks `main` in
`lakefile.lean`, with the exact revision recorded in `lake-manifest.json`. Run
`scripts/lake.sh update floatlib` to adopt newer FloatLib changes, then rebuild and test TorchLean.

## CPU Installation

The build wrapper requires Bash and Python 3. Install the compiler tools described for your
platform below before building.

First install [Elan](https://github.com/leanprover/elan), the Lean toolchain manager. On Linux or
macOS:

```bash
curl https://elan.lean-lang.org/elan-init.sh -sSf | sh
```

Open a new terminal so that `elan`, `lean`, and `lake` are on your `PATH`. Then clone and build
TorchLean:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean.git
cd TorchLean
scripts/lake.sh exe cache get
scripts/lake.sh build
```

The cache command downloads compatible prebuilt Lean dependencies when they are available. It is
safe to omit; `scripts/lake.sh build` will compile anything that is missing.

Use `scripts/lake.sh` for commands in this checkout. It keeps CPU and CUDA artifacts in separate
cache directories and holds a checkout lock while Lake runs. If you previously built with raw
Lake and `.lake/build` is a real directory, move it aside once before using the wrapper.

Run a small model to check the executable path:

```bash
scripts/lake.sh exe torchlean quickstart_mlp --device cpu --steps 10
```

If those commands succeed, TorchLean is installed. You can inspect the available examples and
verification commands with:

```bash
scripts/lake.sh exe torchlean --help
scripts/lake.sh exe verify --help
```

That CPU build is the common starting point on every platform. From there, TorchLean can link
its LibTorch CUDA backend without changing the Lean model being run.
The table below separates paths that work today from platforms that still need platform-specific
runtime work.

| Platform | CPU | NVIDIA GPU | LibTorch provider | Current status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Linux | &#10003; | &#10003; Through LibTorch | Tensor operations and local gradients | Supported |
| macOS, Intel or Apple silicon | &#10003; | Not applicable | Not yet | CPU supported; Metal is planned |
| Windows with WSL2 | &#10003; Linux path | &#10003; CUDA on WSL2 | Linux path | Recommended Windows setup |
| Native Windows (MSYS2) | &#10003; | &#10003; LibTorch backend | `cuda=true` builds the LibTorch backend | CPU, CUDA, and LibTorch build natively; see Native Windows |

LibTorch is the standard CUDA backend: build with `-Kcuda=true` and run with `--device cuda`.
You can also request `--device gpu` (or `.gpu` in Lean). Currently it selects CUDA through
LibTorch and fails if that GPU runtime is unavailable; it does not fall back to CPU.
A plain build still uses the portable CPU runtime and does not link LibTorch.
The GPU backend uses ATen, LibTorch's tensor library. TorchLean retains its own tape, backward
traversal, and optimizer state. Native operations compute tensor values and local gradients with
LibTorch autograd recording disabled. The CPU build remains independent of LibTorch.

## Linux

### CPU

You need Git, `curl`, Bash, Python 3, and a C/C++ compiler. On Ubuntu or Debian:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y git curl bash python3 build-essential
```

Then follow the CPU installation steps above. The default build uses the portable CPU runtime.
One unavailable-backend shim supplies the GPU symbols so CPU-only machines can compile the
complete Lean project. GPU requests fail with instructions to rebuild with LibTorch.

Linux native targets also build a private mimalloc 3.4.4 object from checksum-pinned source.
Position-independent code and initial-exec thread-local storage let it link into executables and
shared libraries. It includes a narrow arena-purge wakeup repair; the installed Lean compiler and
`#eval` keep their existing allocator. The
[native allocation boundary](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/blob/main/docs/TRUST_BOUNDARIES.md#native-host-allocation)
describes the repair and its remaining assumptions.

### NVIDIA CUDA

Install a supported NVIDIA driver and CUDA toolkit using NVIDIA's
[CUDA Installation Guide for Linux](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/).
Download a CUDA-enabled SDK from the
[LibTorch installation page](https://docs.pytorch.org/cppdocs/installing.html), using its supported
C++ compiler and matching CUDA toolkit. The SDK must contain `include/`, `lib/`, and
`share/cmake/Torch/TorchConfig.cmake`. The bridge needs CMake 3.22 or later, Make, and Python 3.
Check the machine before rebuilding:

```bash
nvidia-smi
nvcc --version
```

Build and run the CUDA configuration, pointing to the extracted SDK:

```bash
export TORCHLEAN_LIBTORCH_HOME=/absolute/path/to/libtorch
scripts/lake.sh -Kcuda=true build
scripts/lake.sh -Kcuda=true exe torchlean quickstart_mlp \
  --device cuda --steps 10 --show-backend
```

The two CUDA choices happen at different times. `-Kcuda=true` tells Lake to compile the C++
adapters and link LibTorch. `--device cuda` asks the executable to use it. A CPU-linked executable
rejects `--device cuda` instead of silently moving the run back to the CPU.

The wrapper selects the CUDA build cache and passes `-R` to Lake automatically, recomputing the
build description when you switch configurations. The CUDA regression suite is:

```bash
TORCHLEAN_REQUIRE_CUDA=1 scripts/lake.sh -Kcuda=true exe nn_tests_suite
```

The [CUDA guide]({{ '/cuda/' | relative_url }}) covers deterministic reductions, parity checks,
sanitizers, and the remaining native-code trust boundary.

The SDK's CMake configuration supplies its compiler ABI flags and library dependencies. TorchLean
compiles C++ adapters; the SDK supplies GPU kernels and their supported architectures. You can
also pass the SDK path directly to Lake:

```bash
scripts/lake.sh -Kcuda=true \
  -Klibtorch_home=/absolute/path/to/libtorch build
scripts/lake.sh -Kcuda=true \
  -Klibtorch_home=/absolute/path/to/libtorch exe libtorch_sdpa_test
```

The maintained CUDA profile uses attention composed in Lean from matrix products, masking,
softmax, and an explicit local VJP. LibTorch supplies the numerical primitives; TorchLean's tape
owns Q/K/V and the saved probabilities. The full score matrices require quadratic memory in
sequence length. The
[backend chapter]({{ '/blueprint/Runtime___-Autograd___-and-Interop/Inside-The-Backend-Planner/' | relative_url }})
explains its per-operation selection and backward boundary.

## macOS

Install Apple's command-line developer tools and ensure Python 3 is available, then install Elan
and TorchLean:

```bash
xcode-select --install
curl https://elan.lean-lang.org/elan-init.sh -sSf | sh
git clone https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean.git
cd TorchLean
scripts/lake.sh exe cache get
scripts/lake.sh build
scripts/lake.sh exe torchlean quickstart_mlp --device cpu --steps 10
```

The CPU path works on Intel and Apple silicon. Modern macOS has no NVIDIA CUDA execution path.
TorchLean already reserves `--device metal` in its device vocabulary, but Metal/MPS kernels are not
implemented yet. Selecting Metal therefore returns an unsupported-device error; it does not quietly
run the CPU implementation.

## Windows

### Recommended: WSL2

The most reliable Windows setup is Ubuntu under WSL2. Open an administrator PowerShell prompt:

```powershell
wsl --install -d Ubuntu
```

After Windows restarts, open Ubuntu and follow the Linux instructions. For an NVIDIA GPU, follow
NVIDIA's [CUDA on WSL guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/wsl-user-guide/index.html). Install the
Windows NVIDIA driver and the CUDA toolkit inside WSL; do not install a second Linux display driver
inside WSL.

### Native Windows (MSYS2)

**NOTE: WSL2 remains the most regularly tested Windows route, but the native
CPU, CUDA, and LibTorch paths below are built and run today.**

Native Windows builds run inside an [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) **UCRT64** shell. Install
MSYS2, then Elan from the [manual install instructions](https://lean-lang.org/install/manual/).
Lake invokes `cc` directly, and the standard Lean for Windows toolchain does not put a `cc` on
`PATH`, so the build must run inside MSYS2 (which provides `gcc`/`cc`). From a **UCRT64** shell
install the C/C++ toolchain:

```bash
pacman -S --needed mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-gcc mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-clang mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-cmake mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-ninja
```

Open a new UCRT64 shell so `elan`, `lean`, `lake`, and `cc` are on `PATH`, then clone and build
the CPU configuration:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean.git
cd TorchLean
lake exe cache get
lake build
lake exe torchlean quickstart_mlp --device cpu --steps 10
```

#### NVIDIA CUDA (LibTorch backend)

The CUDA configuration builds the LibTorch backend natively. You need the Windows NVIDIA driver,
the [NVIDIA CUDA toolkit for Windows](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads), the Visual
Studio C++ build tools, and a CUDA-enabled LibTorch SDK from the
[LibTorch installation page](https://docs.pytorch.org/cppdocs/installing.html). The backend C++
source is compiled with MSYS2's `clang-cl`, which needs the MSVC and Windows SDK headers — start
the MSYS2 shell from an environment where `vcvars64.bat` has already run (e.g. an *x64 Native
Tools Command Prompt*, launching `msys2_shell.cmd -ucrt64` from it), leaving `INCLUDE` and `LIB`
set and `cl.exe` on `PATH`.

The native Windows port uses Lake directly (artifacts stay in the in-repo `.lake/build`).
Note that the `scripts/lake.sh` wrapper is *NOT* applicable here.
Build, run, and test the attention smoke test with:

```bash
lake -R -K cuda=true \
  -K cuda_home="C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v13.3" \
  -K msys2_lib_dir="C:/msys64/ucrt64/lib" \
  -K libtorch_home="C:/path/to/libtorch" \
  build
lake -R -K cuda=true \
  -K cuda_home="C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v13.3" \
  -K msys2_lib_dir="C:/msys64/ucrt64/lib" \
  -K libtorch_home="C:/path/to/libtorch" \
  exe torchlean quickstart_mlp --device cuda --steps 10 --show-backend
PATH="/c/path/to/libtorch/lib:$PATH" ./.lake/build/bin/libtorch_sdpa_test.exe
```

`-K cuda_home` and `-K msys2_lib_dir` are required on Windows; the build fails early with a clear
message when either is missing. `-K msvc_lib_dir` is optional — the helper derives the MSVC `lib`
directory from `cl.exe`'s location on `PATH` (pass it explicitly only for unusual installs).
`-K cuda_arch` is not used: the SDK's CMake configuration supplies the supported GPU
architectures.

At run time the CUDA toolkit `bin` directory (for `cudart64_*`, `cublas64_*`, `cufft64_*`) and
the LibTorch `lib` directory (for `torch.dll`, `torch_cpu.dll`, `torch_cuda.dll`, `c10.dll`,
`c10_cuda.dll`) must be on `PATH`; Windows has no rpath.


## Use TorchLean From Another Lean Project

Add TorchLean to the downstream project's `lakefile.lean`:

```lean
require TorchLean from git "https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean.git" @ "main"
```

Then update and build from the downstream project's root using its own Lake configuration:

```bash
lake update
lake exe cache get
lake build
```

Most model files need only:

```lean
import NN.API
open TorchLean
```

Scalar arithmetic and numerical proofs come from the separate
[FloatLib package](https://github.com/lean-dojo/FloatLib), included as a pinned dependency:

```lean
import FloatLib
open FloatLib.Floats

abbrev Binary128 :=
  ExecFloat.Binary (exponentBits := 15) (fractionBits := 112)

def reading : Binary128 := 1.5
def scaled : Binary128 := reading * 2.25
```

Here the type chooses 113 bits of significand precision in a 128-bit IEEE layout. Literals are
rounded from exact rationals directly into the selected format. Wider software formats use the
same public arithmetic interface; selecting one does not add arbitrary-precision hardware support
to CUDA or cuBLAS.

`import FloatLib` supplies configured numerical types, reference semantics, refinement theorems,
and intervals without importing TorchLean's model or runtime layers. Binary elementary functions
have a separate import,
`FloatLib.Floats.Formats.BinaryInterchange.Configured.Transcendentals`; they are deterministic
approximations and need their own accuracy claims. Tensor quantization and graph-level numerical
proofs remain TorchLean integrations.

For development against a neighboring checkout, use a path dependency:

```lean
require TorchLean from "../TorchLean"
```

## From A Model To A Kernel

Installation chooses a device or a complete backend profile; the model API stays the same. Each
operation an eager session executes is first matched to a `KernelCapsule`: a record naming the
operation, provider, device, trust level (`checked` or `trustedExternal`), VJP mode, and four
contract descriptors (shape, layout, value, VJP) with their evidence. Its `numericalPolicy` has one
field, `reduction`, which says whether the kernel accumulates in the fixed left-fold order of the
tensor semantics or in an implementation-defined order. The numerical certificate registry reads
that field, so a CUDA or LibTorch capsule cannot inherit a fixed-left reduction certificate.

Selection has three steps. The planner picks the first capsule whose device, provider preference,
VJP mode, and trust level fit the profile. `checkContracts` then produces a `ContractCheck` that
rejects any selected descriptor whose evidence the profile's assurance policy does not admit. The
session finally calls `KernelCapsule.bind` to pair the capsule with a handler for the same
operation, provider, and device before running it. Unavailable providers fail at that point instead
of quietly changing the request. `--show-backend` prints each selected capsule the first time a
session uses it.

`checked_cuda` selects LibTorch numerical operations. Attention retains the capsule name
`libtorch.direct_attention` and reports `torchlean-tape`: Lean composes its local VJP and manages
the saved buffers. Capsules labelled `backend-vjp` instead call a native routine for their local
reverse rule. TorchLean traverses the tape and accumulates gradients in both cases. Attention has
one CUDA implementation; there is no separate fused-attention provider to select.

Read [Inside the Backend Planner]({{ '/blueprint/Runtime___-Autograd___-and-Interop/Inside-The-Backend-Planner/' | relative_url }})
for capsules, provider preference, VJP ownership, assurance policies, and backend reports. Read
[From a Tensor Operation to a GPU Kernel]({{ '/blueprint/Floating-Point-and-Native-Boundaries/From-A-Tensor-Operation-To-A-GPU-Kernel/' | relative_url }})
for native CUDA dispatch, boundary checks, determinism, and the current operation coverage.

## Check An Installation

These commands cover the normal CPU installation:

```bash
scripts/lake.sh build
scripts/lake.sh lint
scripts/lake.sh exe nn_tests_suite
scripts/lake.sh exe torchlean --help
scripts/lake.sh exe verify --help
```

For CUDA, rebuild with `scripts/lake.sh -Kcuda=true build`, then run the suite with
`TORCHLEAN_REQUIRE_CUDA=1 scripts/lake.sh -Kcuda=true exe nn_tests_suite`. The environment
variable makes an unavailable CUDA runtime a failure instead of allowing CUDA tests to skip.

For a complete account of Lean axioms, executable checkers, CUDA and FFI code, external artifact
producers, and floating-point assumptions, read
