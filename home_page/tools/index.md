    <h2>LeanProfiler</h2>
    <p>
      LeanProfiler records nested <code>IO</code> spans, structured runtime metadata, Lean
      heartbeats, and process resource counters. It writes a Trace Event file for Perfetto and a
      JSON summary that can be compared with an earlier run.
    </p>
    <p>
      The TorchLean example wraps an existing model runner. Device completion hooks can include
      synchronized work in a span, and the report labels that measurement as
      completion latency rather than device-kernel time.

    <h2>TorchLean Verified Examples</h2>
    <p>
      TorchLean Verified Examples develops larger case studies outside the core library. They range
      from batch-invariant inference and replayable checkpoints to GPT training and a formal Kimi
      K3 architecture specification. Each project identifies its Lean statements and remaining
      runtime assumptions; the Kimi K3 case study formalizes architecture properties.
