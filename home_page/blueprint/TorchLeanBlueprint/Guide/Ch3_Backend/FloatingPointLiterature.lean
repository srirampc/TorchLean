A rounding error in the first linear layer becomes part of the input to ReLU and then to the
second layer. The later operations may preserve, amplify, or reduce it while introducing errors
of their own. Bounding each operation in isolation leaves out that dependence.

I'll follow the error through the same two-layer MLP used in the executable comparison below.
The local rounding analysis of {Informal.citet goldberg1991}[] gives us a starting point.
FloatLib supplies those scalar facts, and TorchLean's covered tensor operations turn them into
bounds on output tensors. A graph theorem composes the bounds in evaluation order.

Training extends the calculation. Reverse mode reads saved forward values, so their errors
affect the gradient. An optimizer then uses that gradient to change the parameters. With a
contract for each of these operations, we can follow the discrepancy through one complete
training step: forward values, gradients, and the next parameter state.

# Native And Reference MLP Execution

Run the native/reference comparison with:

```terminal
# Compare the executable binary32 model with the Float32
# path on the same MLP.
lake exe torchlean float32_semantics
```

It evaluates

$$`y=W_2\operatorname{ReLU}(W_1x+b_1)+b_2`

twice. The first run uses Lean's native `Float32`; the second uses the independent bit-level
FloatLib binary32 reference. Both runs then compute
the parameter and input VJPs. The following recorded run predates the FloatLib migration; it shows
the comparison's outputs and parameter ordering. It is not validation of the migrated executable:

inputGrad  = [0.760000, 1.000000]
max_abs_diff(Float32 vs IEEE32Exec) = 0
```

The forward result is `2.080000`. The following rows compare the cotangents for both weight
matrices, both biases, and the input. The final line checks the values themselves and reports zero
maximum absolute difference, so agreement is stronger than matching the displayed decimals.

This run compares native execution with an independent integer-arithmetic implementation in
Lean. It is a useful regression check for this input and parameter pack. The approximation
theorems below address quantified claims and state the assumptions needed to connect rounded
calculations to real-valued ones.

The gradient comparison exercises a different part of the computation from the forward comparison.
A scalar output seeded with one asks how that output changes with each parameter, so the printed
weight and bias entries must follow the model's parameter order. Matching only the final output
would miss, for example, a reverse rule that sends the right numbers to the wrong parameter tensor.
The reported zero differences say that these particular executions agree under the example's
comparison; the approximation theorems below explain how to make a statement with explicit input
and arithmetic hypotheses.

# The Approximation Relation

Let $`x` be an ideal real tensor, $`\widehat{x}` its rounded counterpart with the same shape, and
$`\varepsilon` a bound on their coordinatewise error. A map `toSpec` interprets each rounded
scalar as a real value. TorchLean writes the relation as

$$`\operatorname{approxTensor}(x,\widehat x,\varepsilon)
  \quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad
  \forall i,\;
  |\operatorname{toSpec}(\widehat x_i)-x_i|\leq\varepsilon`.

The index $`i` ranges over the tensor's coordinates, so the same bound applies at every entry.
For `NF`, `toSpec` returns the stored real value. For another runtime type, the map can be
different.

The signature says the same thing more tersely:

```lean (name := approxTensorSig)
-- Expose the scalar interpretation and the shared
-- coordinatewise error budget.
#check @approxTensor
```
```leanOutput approxTensorSig (whitespace := lax)
@approxTensor : {α : Type} → [inst : Storage α] →
  {s : Spec.Shape} → (α → Spec.SpecScalar) →
    Spec.SpecTensor s → Tensor α s → Spec.SpecScalar → Prop
```

The last argument is the error bound. Passing it separately lets graph propagation update the
bound without rebuilding the tensor. It also lets us relate the same runtime value to several ideal
values, each with its own error. The `toSpec` argument selects how to interpret the runtime scalar.

The shared shape fixes which coordinates are compared. A budget of $`\varepsilon` permits that much
error at each coordinate, so summing many coordinates can require a larger output budget even when
every input satisfies the same relation. Reading the relation this way explains why a layer theorem
needs an error transformer as well as an input approximation hypothesis.

# Error Bounds For A Linear Layer

For one output coordinate, an exact affine layer computes

$$`y_j=\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}W_{jk}x_k+b_j`.

Here $`j` selects an output coordinate and $`n` is the input width. Suppose the runtime has
approximations $`\widehat W`, $`\widehat x`, and $`\widehat b` with coordinatewise errors
$`\varepsilon_W`, $`\varepsilon_x`, and $`\varepsilon_b`. In the following error calculation,
the hatted operands denote their decoded real values. Before accounting for arithmetic rounding,
one product satisfies

$$`
|\widehat W_{jk}\widehat x_k-W_{jk}x_k|
\leq
|W_{jk}|\,\varepsilon_x
+|x_k|\,\varepsilon_W
+\varepsilon_W\varepsilon_x.
`

To obtain the bound, expand the perturbed product and group the error in each operand. Suppressing
the coordinate indices gives

$$`
\widehat W\widehat x-Wx
=W(\widehat x-x)+x(\widehat W-W)
  +(\widehat W-W)(\widehat x-x).
`

The first term propagates input error through the exact weight; the second propagates weight
error through the exact input. The third accounts for perturbing both operands at once.

Arithmetic introduces further error. Write $`P_k` for the total error charged to product $`k`
and $`E_k` for the accumulated error after $`k` products. Let $`s_k` and $`p_k` be the ideal
partial sum and product. In the recurrence below, $`\rho_{\rm mul}(W_{jk},x_k)` must bound
multiplication rounding throughout the operand neighborhoods given by $`\varepsilon_W` and
$`\varepsilon_x`. Likewise, $`\rho_{\rm add}(s_k,p_k)` must cover the partial sum and product
errors $`E_k` and $`P_k`. These error radii are implicit arguments of the notation; evaluating
rounding error only at the ideal operands would not suffice. With an exact zero accumulator, a
fixed-left dot product has the recurrence

$$`
\begin{aligned}
E_0 &= 0,\\
P_k &=
  |W_{jk}|\,\varepsilon_x
  +|x_k|\,\varepsilon_W
  +\varepsilon_W\varepsilon_x
  +\rho_{\rm mul}(W_{jk},x_k),\\
E_{k+1} &= E_k+P_k+\rho_{\rm add}(s_k,p_k).
\end{aligned}
`

Each step adds the previous sum error, the new product's error, and the rounding error of combining
them. After the final product, add $`\varepsilon_b` and the rounding of the bias addition. The
local rounding bounds must cover the operands reached by this execution, which is why the theorem
needs both a reduction order and magnitude information.

The `NF` backend implements this style of propagation with bounds computed from runtime operands.
In `NFBackend.dotStep`, the magnitude terms use the decoded rounded operands plus their error
budgets, and the local rounding terms are half-ULP bounds at the runtime product and sum before
rounding. `dotBound` also conservatively charges half an ULP for its initial zero accumulator.
Thus the implementation follows the error decomposition above without using exactly the same
bound expression. Matrix multiplication, convolution, reductions, and scalar arithmetic each
provide an error transformer and a theorem proving that transformer valid.

There are two sources of uncertainty in a dot product. The represented weights and inputs may
already differ from the intended real data, and each multiplication and addition introduces a new
rounding step. Even an exact multiplication of the represented operands would retain the first
source. Conversely, exactly represented input data do not make every intermediate product or sum
representable. Keeping the two contributions separate lets a caller improve the right part of a
failed bound: a more accurate parameter conversion and a different accumulation algorithm solve
different problems.

# Accumulated Error Bounds And Measurements

The recurrence bounds absolute errors and does not exploit cancellation between local rounding
errors. It is not automatically linear in the number of terms: local magnitudes and rounding bounds
may also grow. Under the classical relative-error model, with $`nu<1` and no problematic
underflow or overflow, a sequential sum satisfies

$$`|\widehat S-S|\leq\gamma_n\sum_i|x_i|,\qquad
\gamma_n=nu/(1-nu).`

Here $`u=2^{-24}` for binary32, and using $`n` instead of $`n-1` is a conservative convention.
This becomes a relative bound of $`\gamma_n` for nonnegative terms with nonzero sum. For mixed
signs, divide by $`|S|` and retain the condition factor $`\sum_i|x_i|/|S|`.

The following harmonic-sum experiment compares binary32 against a binary64 reference. Its positive
terms keep the condition factor at one. Each term is first computed in binary64 and converted to
binary32, so the observed difference includes term conversion as well as accumulation; the printed
classical factor is a comparison scale, not a Lean proof about this complete experiment.

```lean (name := gammaGrow)
-- Compare accumulated harmonic sums with the growth of the
-- classical gamma factor.
-- The binary64 sum is a numerical reference, not an
-- exact-real oracle.
def harm32 (n : Nat) : (ExecFloat.Binary 8 23) :=
  (List.range n).foldl
    (fun acc k =>
      ExecFloat.add acc
        ((ExecFloat.Binary.ofFloat32 ∘ Float.toFloat32)
          (1.0 / Nat.toFloat (k + 1))))
    0

def harm64 (n : Nat) : Float :=
  (List.range n).foldl
    (fun acc k => acc + 1.0 / Nat.toFloat (k + 1)) 0.0

-- Unit roundoff for binary32, and Higham's growth factor.
def u32 : Float := 1.0 / 16777216.0

def gammaN (n : Nat) : Float :=
  Nat.toFloat n * u32 / (1.0 - Nat.toFloat n * u32)

#eval do
  for n in [4, 16, 64, 256, 1024, 4096] do
    let ideal := harm64 n
    let got :=
      (ExecFloat.Binary.toFloat32 (harm32 n)).toFloat
    let rel := ((got - ideal) / ideal).abs
    IO.println s!"n={n} observed={rel / u32} u  \
      bound={gammaN n / u32} u"
```
```leanOutput gammaGrow (whitespace := lax)
n=4 observed=1.280000 u  bound=4.000001 u
n=16 observed=0.164718 u  bound=16.000015 u
n=64 observed=2.872767 u  bound=64.000244 u
n=256 observed=2.237023 u  bound=256.003906 u
n=1024 observed=16.215394 u  bound=1024.062504 u
n=4096 observed=8.159338 u  bound=4097.000244 u
```

Both columns are in multiples of $`u`. The comparison factor is approximately $`n`, while the
observed error is much smaller at the larger lengths and is not monotone. These deterministic data
do not establish a random-walk law or a $`\sqrt n` growth rate.

A worst-case bound need not predict typical error. It can also be sharpened by using more facts
about the inputs or intermediate values. Changing the program offers another route: compensated
summation, a pairwise reduction with logarithmic depth, or a wider accumulator. Each needs an error
contract matching the implemented arithmetic. The reduction theorem below makes its hypotheses
explicit; it does not certify the printed $`\gamma_n` column unconditionally.

The table's observed discrepancy and its theoretical factor answer different questions. The former
compares two computed sums of the chosen harmonic terms. The latter describes how a local relative
error assumption can grow with the number of rounding steps. To turn that factor into an absolute
bound, one also needs a scale, such as the sum of the magnitudes of the terms, and must justify the
local assumption for the arithmetic path. A small measured discrepancy can coexist with a much
larger valid bound because the bound must permit error signs that this example never realizes.

# Sequential, Pairwise, And Compensated Summation

Keep the converted harmonic terms fixed and change only the accumulation algorithm. The naive
column uses the `harm32` fold above. The pairwise column adds neighbours in rounds until one value
remains. Kahan summation keeps a correction for rounding lost at the previous addition and uses
it to adjust the next term. All three are compared with the same binary64 reference.

```lean (name := sumStrategies)
-- The same term the naive fold above added.
def harmTerm (k : Nat) : (ExecFloat.Binary 8 23) :=
  (ExecFloat.Binary.ofFloat32 ∘ Float.toFloat32)
    (1.0 / Nat.toFloat (k + 1))

-- Pairwise reduction: logarithmic depth instead of linear.
-- An odd element rides to the next round untouched.
def harmPairwise32 (n : Nat) :
    (ExecFloat.Binary 8 23) := Id.run do
  let mut level : Array (ExecFloat.Binary 8 23) :=
    (Array.range n).map harmTerm
  while level.size > 1 do
    let mut next : Array (ExecFloat.Binary 8 23) := #[]
    for i in [0 : level.size / 2] do
      next := next.push
        (ExecFloat.add level[2 * i]! level[2 * i + 1]!)
    if level.size % 2 == 1 then
      next := next.push level[level.size - 1]!
    level := next
  pure level[0]!

-- Kahan compensated summation. `drift` holds the part of
-- the last addend that did not fit into the accumulator,
-- recovered by subtracting the old accumulator back out.
def harmKahan32 (n : Nat) : (ExecFloat.Binary 8 23) :=
  ((List.range n).foldl
    (fun (state : (ExecFloat.Binary 8 23) ×
        (ExecFloat.Binary 8 23)) k =>
      let (total, drift) := state
      let adjusted := ExecFloat.sub (harmTerm k) drift
      let next := ExecFloat.add total adjusted
      let recovered := ExecFloat.sub next total
      (next, ExecFloat.sub recovered adjusted))
    (0, 0)).fst

#eval do
  for n in [64, 256, 1024, 4096] do
    let ideal := harm64 n
    let err := fun (got : (ExecFloat.Binary 8 23)) =>
      (((ExecFloat.Binary.toFloat32 got).toFloat - ideal)
        / ideal).abs / u32
    IO.println s!"n={n} naive={err (harm32 n)} \
      pairwise={err (harmPairwise32 n)} \
      kahan={err (harmKahan32 n)}"
```
```leanOutput sumStrategies (whitespace := lax)
n=64 naive=2.872767 pairwise=1.186388 kahan=0.499992
n=256 naive=2.237023 pairwise=0.930761 kahan=0.375501
n=1024 naive=16.215394 pairwise=1.300308 kahan=0.234945
n=4096 naive=8.159338 pairwise=2.763110 kahan=0.964368
```

Pairwise summation stays below three units of roundoff across a factor of sixty-four in length,
while the naive fold reaches sixteen. A depth-based worst-case analysis explains one advantage: in
a 4096-term pairwise reduction every input passes through twelve additions instead of up to 4096.
The classical
analysis of the pairwise scheme replaces $`\gamma_n` by $`\gamma_{\lceil\log_2 n\rceil}`, which at
$`n=4096` is about twelve units of roundoff instead of four thousand. Kahan stays below one unit
in these
four runs. In the code, `recovered` subtracts the old total from the new one to estimate how much
of `adjusted` entered the accumulator. The difference is retained as `drift` and subtracted from
the next term. This explains the role of the correction without turning these measurements into
a general error bound.

TorchLean's reduction theory represents schedules such as the pairwise one through `SumTree`.
`sumTreeResult xs r` says that some schedule over some
permutation of the inputs produces `r` with finite leaves and finite intermediate results, and the
enclosure theorem bounds the error of
whichever schedule that was:

```lean (name := sumTreeEnc)
-- Read the reduction-order witness and the local rounding
-- assumption together.
#check @IEEE32Exec.sumTreeResult_enclosure
```
```leanOutput sumTreeEnc (whitespace := lax)
IEEE32Exec.sumTreeResult_enclosure : ∀

                  (ReductionBound.growth u t.leafCount - 1) * IEEE32Exec.sumAbsIEEE t
```

The hypothesis `RelativeLocalAddBound` needs particular care. It quantifies over *all real*
operands, not just the intermediates of this execution. For gradual-underflow FP32 rounding, the
usual $`u=2^{-24}` does not satisfy that global hypothesis near zero. Proving that one tree has
normal intermediate sums does not supply this universally quantified premise. Consequently this
theorem alone cannot be instantiated with the usual unit roundoff to certify the measured table.
A usable normal-path result would need a premise restricted to the tree's intermediates, or an
absolute/mixed rounding model that handles underflow.

Under its stated hypothesis, `ReductionBound.growth u t.leafCount` is $`(1+u)^{n-1}` for $`n`
leaves. It does not depend on tree depth, so it charges the same factor to a balanced schedule and
a sequential one. A sharper logarithmic-depth bound requires another theorem. The current library
also does not provide a complete compensated-summation error contract. Its proved Sterbenz
subtraction lemma is a useful ingredient, but does not by itself prove the Kahan program above.

In `sumTreeResult_enclosure`, the existential tree is the record of an allowed reduction order.
The permutation condition says that its leaves contain the supplied summands, with multiplicity;
it does not let the evaluator drop an inconvenient term. The local addition hypothesis must then
hold at the scale used by the theorem. In particular, a relative bound with a small constant cannot
simply be assumed for every real input in a format with a fixed subnormal spacing. The theorem's
current growth expression uses leaf count. A sharper estimate based on balanced-tree depth would
be an additional theorem, even though the pairwise program visibly has that balanced structure.

# Cancellation And Relative Error

The harmonic terms were positive, so their sum and sum of absolute values were equal. With mixed
signs, cancellation can make the final sum much smaller than the intermediate magnitudes. Add a
large number, a small one, and the negative of the large one in left-to-right order:

```lean (name := cancelSum)
-- Keep the summands fixed and change their order to expose
-- cancellation.
def cancelTerms : Array (ExecFloat.Binary 8 23) :=
  #[ (ExecFloat.Binary.ofFloat32 ∘ Float.toFloat32) 1.0e8
   , (ExecFloat.Binary.ofFloat32 ∘ Float.toFloat32) 1.0
   , (ExecFloat.Binary.ofFloat32 ∘ Float.toFloat32)
       (-1.0e8) ]

def foldLeft32 (xs : Array (ExecFloat.Binary 8 23)) :
    (ExecFloat.Binary 8 23) :=
  xs.foldl ExecFloat.add 0

-- Same three numbers, small term last.
def cancelReordered : Array (ExecFloat.Binary 8 23) :=
  #[ cancelTerms[0]!, cancelTerms[2]!, cancelTerms[1]! ]

#eval do
  let sumAbs :=
    cancelTerms.foldl
      (fun acc (x : (ExecFloat.Binary 8 23)) =>
        acc + (ExecFloat.Binary.toFloat32 x).toFloat.abs)
      0.0
  -- Growth factor for a three-leaf schedule: (1+u)^2 - 1.
  let growth := (1.0 + u32) * (1.0 + u32) - 1.0
  let naive :=
    (ExecFloat.Binary.toFloat32
      (foldLeft32 cancelTerms)).toFloat
  let reordered :=
    (ExecFloat.Binary.toFloat32
      (foldLeft32 cancelReordered)).toFloat
  IO.println s!"naive     = {naive}"
  IO.println s!"reordered = {reordered}"
  IO.println s!"exact     = 1.0"
  IO.println s!"sumAbs    = {sumAbs}"
  IO.println s!"bound     = {growth * sumAbs}"
```
```leanOutput cancelSum (whitespace := lax)
naive     = 0.000000
reordered = 1.000000
exact     = 1.0
sumAbs    = 200000001.000000
bound     = 23.841859
```

The naive order loses the answer completely. The two magnitudes are eight decimal orders apart and
binary32 keeps twenty four significand bits, so `1e8 + 1` returns `1e8` unchanged and the final
subtraction returns zero. Relative to the exact answer that is a one hundred percent error. Move the
small term to the end and the same three numbers add up exactly.

The bound in `sumTreeResult_enclosure` scales with `sumAbsIEEE`, the sum of absolute values.
Here that factor is approximately $`2\times 10^8` while the
answer is $`1`, so
the illustrative growth formula gives an absolute bound of about twenty-four, while the observed
error is one. Turning an absolute bound into relative accuracy requires the
condition number $`\sum_i|x_i|\,/\,|\sum_i x_i|`, approximately $`2\times 10^8` on this input.

An absolute-error certificate can therefore be sound while giving a weak relative bound on a
nearly cancelled result. Reporting `sumAbs` beside the bound makes that scale visible.
Reordering also matters: the same inputs produced either zero or one here. `sumTreeResult`
allows permutations of the inputs; applying a theorem about one particular schedule requires
establishing that the runtime used it.

Compensation attempts to preserve the unit contribution lost at the first addition. To claim a
stronger guarantee for that program, we would need an argument about how its correction variable
behaves as well as a bound on each primitive operation.

# ReLU Lipschitz Bounds

ReLU is easier because it is 1-Lipschitz:

$$`
|\operatorname{ReLU}(u)-\operatorname{ReLU}(v)|
\leq |u-v|.
`

In Lean, with ReLU spelled as `max 0`:

```lean
-- A ReLU cannot increase the distance between two scalar
-- inputs.
example (u v : ℝ) :
    |max 0 u - max 0 v| ≤ |u - v| :=
  relu_scalar_lipschitz u v
```

If the runtime ReLU itself is exact for the declared scalar semantics, an incoming bound
$`\varepsilon` remains $`\varepsilon`. The interesting case is when $`u` and $`v` lie on opposite
sides of zero. The derivative changes discontinuously there, but the forward Lipschitz bound still
holds, and the four-case proof of the scalar theorem is where that is checked.

The tensor statement is the same fact in the $`\ell_2` metric, for every shape at once:

```lean (name := reluTensorSig)
-- The tensor theorem lifts the scalar estimate to the
-- stated tensor norm.
#check @relu_lipschitz_general
```
```leanOutput reluTensorSig (whitespace := lax)
@relu_lipschitz_general : ∀ {s : Spec.Shape} (x y : Tensor ℝ s),
  tensorL2Dist (Activation.reluSpec x) (Activation.reluSpec y) ≤
    tensorL2Dist x y
```

This difference between forward and backward sensitivity matters. A small perturbation can leave
the ReLU output close while changing which VJP branch is selected. Backward approximation
therefore carries branch hypotheses or a bound that covers both possibilities rather than blindly
reusing the forward proof.

We can see the forward argument directly when the inputs straddle zero: removing the negative
part shortens their distance. The outputs stay close even though the reverse rules select
different slopes. That is why the forward bound needs no same-branch hypothesis.

# Range Conditions For Softmax And Normalization

For a nonlinear operation such as softmax, a global absolute-error rule is usually too weak.
TorchLean's stable softmax first subtracts the row maximum:

$$`
\operatorname{softmax}(z)_i
=
\frac{\exp(z_i-\max_j z_j)}
     {\sum_k\exp(z_k-\max_j z_j)}.
`

For a nonempty row of real logits, every shifted exponent input is nonpositive, the denominator
is at least one, and the output lies in $`[0,1]`. Floating-point NaNs and infinities require
separate treatment. Those range facts control the local Lipschitz and rounding terms.

For layer normalization, let $`\mu` be the mean over the normalized coordinates and $`\sigma^2`
their variance. The positive stabilization constant $`\epsilon` is part of the operation,
distinct from the approximation-error bounds above. The calculation proceeds through

$$`
x
\longmapsto \mu

Subtracting the mean produces centered values; squaring and averaging them produces the variance.
Adding $`\epsilon` gives the exact stabilized variance a positive lower bound. Rounding errors must
also be small enough to preserve that margin. The theorem `approxTensor_normalizeCore` assumes
a lower bound $`\eta>0` for the exact stabilized variance and checks that `stabilizedError < η`
and `stdError < Real.sqrt η`. The first keeps the perturbed square-root input positive; the second
keeps the perturbed denominator away from zero. Its error trace composes the subtraction,
stabilization, square-root, division, and affine-scaling bounds, using the supplied error bounds
for the input, mean, variance, and affine parameters.

The normalization margins refer to successive stages. First, the error in the stabilized variance
must be smaller than its positive real lower bound; this keeps the rounded square-root input on
the controlled side of zero. Next, the error in the resulting standard deviation must be smaller
than its own lower bound. This second check protects division. The two comparisons involve
different quantities and different units, which is why replacing both with a single informal
claim that epsilon is positive would lose information needed by the proof.

# Composition Over A Graph

A proof-bearing `RevGraph` stores, for every node:

- the exact forward operation;
- the rounded forward operation;
- an error transformer for the forward result;
- the exact and rounded VJPs;
- an error transformer for the VJP;
- proofs for both transformers.

`RevGraph.eval_approx` follows the graph in topological order. If the input context satisfies its
declared bounds, the runtime output context satisfies the bounds computed by
`RevGraph.evalBounds`.

The executable graph interpreter uses `GraphData`, and one theorem connects it to the same forward
result:

```lean (name := evalApproxSig)
-- Erase the local certificates and check which executable
-- forward graph they cover.
#check @NFBackend.eval_approx_graphData
```
```leanOutput evalApproxSig (whitespace := lax)
@NFBackend.eval_approx_graphData :
  ∀ {β : Radix} {fexp : ℤ → ℤ} {rnd : ℝ → ℤ}
    {Γ ss : List Spec.Shape} (g : RevGraph NFBackend.toSpec Γ ss)
    (xS : TensorPack Spec.SpecScalar Γ)
    (xR : TensorPack (NF β fexp rnd) Γ) (epsIn : EList Γ),
  approxCtx NFBackend.toSpec xS xR epsIn →
    approxCtx NFBackend.toSpec (g.evalSpec xS)
      ((LinkAutogradAlgebra.RevGraph.toGraphData g).eval xR ())
      (g.evalBounds epsIn xR)
```

`Γ` lists the input shapes and `ss` lists the shapes appended by the graph. The hypothesis
`approxCtx` relates the exact input pack `xS` to the rounded pack `xR` using `epsIn`.
The conclusion relates the exact evaluation `g.evalSpec xS` to the lowered `GraphData`
evaluation, with one bound per context entry supplied by `g.evalBounds epsIn xR`.
The proof composes the contracts stored in `g`, so a supported graph can come from an MLP, CNN,
transformer, or neural operator.

The forward theorem concludes an approximation for the entire accumulated context. Earlier inputs
and intermediate node values remain available alongside the final output. This is useful when the
next theorem concerns backpropagation, since a local VJP may read saved forward values rather than
only the graph's output. The shape lists in the signature keep those saved entries aligned with
their error budgets. An output-only comparison would leave precisely this information unavailable
to the reverse induction.

# Backward Error Propagation

Reverse mode starts from a seed cotangent and applies local VJPs from outputs back to inputs and
parameters; {Informal.citet baydin2018}[] is the standard survey of the mechanism. For a composition
$`h(x)=g(f(x))`, let $`\bar h` be the seed cotangent at the output and $`J_f`, $`J_g` the
Jacobians of the two functions. The input cotangent is

$$`
\bar x
=J_f(x)^\mathsf{T}
  J_g(f(x))^\mathsf{T}\bar h.
`

Read the product from right to left: the VJP of $`g` maps the seed to a cotangent at the
intermediate
value $`f(x)`, then the VJP of $`f` maps that cotangent back to the input.
The rounded pass perturbs the saved forward values, the seed, each local VJP, and every gradient
accumulation. `RevGraph.backpropBounds` mirrors the runtime traversal and computes the resulting
error context. The backward theorem adds a second `approxCtx` hypothesis for the seed:

```lean (name := backpropApproxSig)
-- The reverse theorem also carries seed errors and rounded
-- gradient accumulation.
#check @NFBackend.backprop_approx_graphData
```
```leanOutput backpropApproxSig (whitespace := lax)
@NFBackend.backprop_approx_graphData :
  ∀ {β : Radix} {fexp : ℤ → ℤ}
    [inst : ValidExp fexp] {rnd : ℝ → ℤ}
    [ValidRndToNearest rnd] {Γ ss : List Spec.Shape}
    (g : RevGraph NFBackend.toSpec Γ ss)
    (xS : TensorPack Spec.SpecScalar Γ)
    (xR : TensorPack (NF β fexp rnd) Γ) (epsIn : EList Γ)
    (seedS : TensorPack Spec.SpecScalar (Γ ++ ss))
    (seedR : TensorPack (NF β fexp rnd) (Γ ++ ss))
    (epsSeed : EList (Γ ++ ss)),
  approxCtx NFBackend.toSpec xS xR epsIn →
    approxCtx NFBackend.toSpec seedS seedR epsSeed →
      approxCtx NFBackend.toSpec (g.backpropSpec xS seedS)
        ((LinkAutogradAlgebra.RevGraph.toGraphData g).backpropCtx xR () seedR)
        (g.backpropBounds epsIn xR epsSeed seedR fun {Δ} =>
          NFBackend.ctxAddBound)
```

So `GraphData.backpropCtx` stays inside the computed context whenever the inputs and seed satisfy
their initial approximation relations. The two instance arguments are the price of using the
nearest-rounding facts from the previous chapter: the exponent policy has to be a valid one and the
integer rounder has to round to nearest.

This is why TorchLean keeps saved values in the numerical model. A backward rule for multiplication
uses the opposite operand; a normalization VJP uses saved statistics; attention backward uses
probabilities and mask semantics from the forward pass. Bounding only the final forward output
would throw away the information needed to analyze those gradients.

A cotangent seed is numerical input to the reverse computation. Scaling the seed scales the ideal
VJP, and errors in that seed also propagate through the local reverse rules. Fanout adds a second
issue: two paths can contribute to the same earlier variable. Their contributions must be summed,
and that sum rounds too. The explicit accumulation contract in the displayed theorem is what
accounts for this shared-variable case; it is not covered merely by bounding each local VJP in
isolation.

# Optimizer Arithmetic

For parameters $`\theta`, gradient $`g`, and learning rate $`\eta`, SGD computes

$$`\theta^+=\theta-\eta g`.

If $`\widehat\theta`, $`\widehat\eta`, and $`\widehat g` approximate their ideal values, the next
parameter bound combines the old parameter error, learning-rate error, gradient error, and local
multiplication/subtraction rounding.

Momentum adds a state recurrence. AdamW, as introduced by {Informal.citet adamw2019}[], adds first
and second moments, bias correction, square root, division, and decoupled weight decay. Rather than
hard-code each optimizer into the graph theorem, TorchLean uses `NumericalStepContract`. A contract
supplies:

- ideal and rounded optimizer states;
- an approximation relation for the state;
- ideal and rounded update functions;
- an error transformer for the new state and parameters;
- a theorem that the transformer is sound.

The generic theorem takes one parameter gradient from reverse mode and passes it through an
optimizer satisfying that interface. Its statement carries the graph, optimizer contract, exact
and runtime states, and their error bounds into a conclusion about the updated state:

```lean
-- Check that an optimizer consumes the gradient bound
-- derived from this graph.
example :=
  @NFBackend.backprop_optimizer_update_approx_graphData
```

SGD, momentum SGD, and AdamW reuse that same graph theorem.

For an SGD step with exact learning rate, a gradient discrepancy of size $`\varepsilon_g`
contributes at most $`|\eta|\varepsilon_g` before the update's own rounding is counted. This gives
a practical interpretation of the optimizer layer: it translates gradient accuracy into parameter
accuracy. It does not say that the updated loss decreases. A descent argument needs properties of
the loss and a suitable step size, while a multi-step numerical argument must also relate the
states and gradients supplied at every later step.

# Runtime Optimizers And Proved Optimizer Contracts

The executable training layer is broader than those three numerical contracts.
`Runtime.Autograd.Train.Optim` implements parameter groups, learning-rate schedulers, shape-checked
optimizer state, and updates for SGD, momentum/Nesterov, AdaGrad, RMSProp, Adam, AdamW, and
Adadelta. `OptimStateDict` preserves the global step, per-parameter Adam steps, group configuration,
and state buffers for save/restore.

Conditional and sparse-gradient models require two counters. The global optimizer-call counter
advances on every step, while an Adam-family parameter advances its bias-correction counter only
when that parameter receives a gradient. Reloaded state and gradients are checked against the
current parameter shape before an update.

The proved NF numerical contracts currently cover plain SGD, momentum SGD, and AdamW; AdamW also
carries the positivity data needed for its square-root denominator. Runtime support for the other
optimizers is implemented and tested, but it should not be described as inheriting those numerical
refinement theorems automatically.

# Graph Numerical Certificates

The executable companion to these approximation theorems works over the canonical IR:

```terminal
# Generate and replay the interval artifact, then try a
# deliberately changed range.
lake exe torchlean numerical_certificate
```

The example constructs a two-layer MLP from ordinary IR operations:

```
-- Each arrow below is an operation whose numerical rule
-- must be available.
input [1,2]
  -> matmul [2,3]
  -> add bias [1,3]
  -> ReLU
  -> matmul [3,1]
  -> add bias [1,1]
```

It generates outward-rounded binary32 ranges for every node, binds them to the selected backend
profile, and replays a concrete FloatLib binary32 execution. The recorded report is:

```terminal +output
TorchLean numerical runtime certificate
  ok  base certificate
  ok  base IEEE replay
  ok  tampered range rejected
  ok  two-layer MLP certificate
  ok  two-layer MLP IEEE replay
All numerical certificate checks passed.
```

The `tampered range rejected` row replaces the addition range with `[0,0]` and checks that the
regenerated trace disagrees. The other four rows generate and replay the scalar example and the
MLP. Backend-policy checks are part of the certificate machinery, but these five rows do not
exercise every policy or failure mode.

Open
{src "NN/Examples/DeepDives/Floats/GraphNumericalCertificate.lean"}[
`GraphNumericalCertificate.lean`] and find `mlpGraph`, `mlpSources`, `mlpPayload`, `mlpCertificate`,
and `mlpReplay`. Change one weight source interval so that it no longer contains the payload value,
then rerun the command. Replay will identify the node whose value escaped the claimed enclosure.

The five success lines describe artifact checks and concrete replay. In particular, rejecting the
changed interval shows that replay uses the reconstructed ranges rather than accepting the
submitted numbers unchecked. The eventual error-width argument has another premise: the exact
real execution must lie in those same ranges. Once both values are enclosed, their separation is
at most the interval width. A narrow interval is therefore useful for both enclosure and error,
but successful replay alone supplies only the rounded side of this argument.

# Training Error Traces

`trainingStepTrace` records the bounds for inspection. Here is its data layout, with empty arrays
standing in for the bounds a calculation would supply:

```lean
-- An empty report illustrates the data layout; it supplies
-- no numerical evidence.
def emptyTrace : NFBackend.TrainingStepTrace where
  optimizerName := "sgd"
  parameterIndex := 0
  forwardErrors := #[]
  backwardErrors := #[]
  gradientError := 0
  parameterError := 0
  optimizerStateErrors := #[]
  assumptions := #[]
```

The numeric fields store error bounds. `forwardErrors` and `backwardErrors` follow typed-context
order, including the input context and appended node results. `gradientError` and `parameterError`
summarize the parameter selected by `parameterIndex`. The `assumptions` field records the numbers
supplied by the caller, so a displayed bound can be read together with the conditions used to
compute it.

The trace is architecture-independent. A frontend can attach names such as
`transformer.blocks.3.attention.q_proj.weight` after lowering, but propagation itself only needs the
typed graph and parameter index. This is a proof-level reporting interface: its bounds are Lean
reals, and an executable dashboard
needs a computable representation and a justified conversion. Constructing a `TrainingStepTrace`
record alone does not attach proofs to its arbitrary fields.

# Training-Step Bound Assumptions

Applying the combined theorem requires a graph of covered operators, initial approximation bounds,
an optimizer with a numerical contract, and arithmetic assumptions matching the execution.
For the MLP, this includes the order used by each dot product and the branch conditions needed by
the ReLU VJP. A native provider's connection to that arithmetic remains part of the backend
contract.

FloatLib keeps format and rounding as separate parameters in its generic results
{Informal.citep flocq2011}[]. To use one in this MLP, we select the parameters and establish its
hypotheses at the relevant operation. The graph and optimizer contracts then carry that local
bound to the updated parameters.
