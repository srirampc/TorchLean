#doc (Manual) "Floating-Point Numerics" =>

The numerical map starts with FloatLib's generic formats and configured executable scalars.
TorchLean keeps two binary32 specializations in view: `FP32` is the imported rounded-real model
with binary32's gradual-underflow grid; `ExecFloat.Binary 8 23` includes signed
zeros, infinities, and NaNs. Bridge theorems connect their finite cases. TorchLean's
runtime-approximation layer then composes local operator bounds over whole forward and backward
graphs. Other configured widths share FloatLib's public scalar API, while a network error bound
must still use the format and operation sequence actually selected.

:::group "generic_numerics"
Generic formats, rounding, and quantization.
:::

:::definition "radix_float_values" (parent := "generic_numerics") (lean := "FloatLib.Floats.Formats.Flocq.FloatRep")
`FloatRep` stores an integer mantissa and exponent at a chosen radix. Its real interpretation is
the exact value of that pair.
:::

:::definition "representable_float_grid" (parent := "generic_numerics") (lean := "FloatLib.Floats.Formats.Flocq.genericFormat")
`genericFormat` says when a real number belongs to the grid selected by a radix and a valid
exponent policy. Fixed, unbounded, and gradual-underflow formats are instances of this setup.
:::

:::definition "nearest_integer_rounding" (parent := "generic_numerics") (lean := "FloatLib.Floats.Formats.Flocq.ValidRndToNearest")
`ValidRndToNearest` is the contract required of an integer rounding rule: it is monotone,
fixes integers, and stays within one half of its input.
:::

:::definition "generic_grid_rounding" (parent := "generic_numerics") (lean := "FloatLib.Floats.Formats.Flocq.round")
`round` scales at the canonical exponent, applies its supplied integer rounding rule, and
maps the resulting {uses "radix_float_values"}[mantissa/exponent pair] back to a real value.
Nearestness and tie handling come from that supplied rule.

The scale is selected from the input magnitude before integer rounding. Separating these choices
lets the same format support nearest and directed modes; a nearest-error theorem cannot be
transferred to a directed mode merely because their representable values coincide.
:::

:::theorem "nearest_rounding_error" (parent := "generic_numerics") (lean := "FloatLib.Floats.Formats.Flocq.error_bound_ulp")
When its integer rule satisfies {uses "nearest_integer_rounding"}[the nearest-rounding contract],
{uses "generic_grid_rounding"}[generic grid rounding] is within half an ULP.
:::

:::proof "nearest_rounding_error"
The proof applies {uses "nearest_integer_rounding"}[the half-integer error bound] to the scaled
mantissa, then rescales it at the exponent used by {uses "generic_grid_rounding"}[the grid rounder].
:::

:::definition "affine_quantizer" (parent := "generic_numerics") (lean := "TorchLean.Floats.Quantization.AffineQuantizer")
A bounded affine quantizer records its positive scale, zero point, and nonempty integer code range.
Its `quantize` operation accepts the integer rounding rule separately.
:::

:::theorem "affine_quantization_accuracy" (parent := "generic_numerics") (lean := "TorchLean.Floats.Quantization.AffineQuantizer.dequantize_quantize_error_le")
An unclipped value passed through the {uses "affine_quantizer"}[affine quantizer] reconstructs
within half a scale step when its integer rule satisfies
{uses "nearest_integer_rounding"}[the nearest-rounding contract].

The unclipped hypothesis says that the rounded code lies inside the allowed integer range. It is
needed because saturation can introduce an error larger than the half-step rounding budget.
:::

:::proof "affine_quantization_accuracy"
The proof applies {uses "nearest_integer_rounding"}[the half-integer error bound] before multiplying
by the positive scale from {uses "affine_quantizer"}[the quantizer].
:::

:::group "binary32_semantics"
Proof-oriented and executable accounts of IEEE 754 binary32.
:::

:::definition "rounded_real_fp32" (parent := "binary32_semantics") (lean := "TorchLean.Floats.FP32")
`FP32` specializes {uses "representable_float_grid"}[the generic format theory] to a proof-oriented
nearest-even model over real values. It leaves out NaNs, infinities, and the upper exponent cutoff,
so claims about those cases belong to FloatLib binary32.
:::

:::theorem "fp32_rounding_accuracy" (parent := "binary32_semantics") (lean := "TorchLean.Floats.FP32.round_abs_error")
Rounding in the {uses "rounded_real_fp32"}[rounded-real model] differs from its real input by at
most half an ULP.
:::

:::proof "fp32_rounding_accuracy"
Unfolding {uses "rounded_real_fp32"}[binary32 rounding] exposes the generic real-valued rounder
with binary32's exponent policy and nearest-even integer rounding. The
{uses "nearest_rounding_error"}[generic half-ULP theorem] then supplies the error bound.
:::

:::definition "executable_binary32" (parent := "binary32_semantics") (lean := "FloatLib.Floats.ExecFloat.Binary")
Choose exponent and fraction widths in FloatLib's configured binary constructor. The `8`, `23`
configuration is binary32; wider and custom formats use the same interface. Encodings drive
executable addition, multiplication, division, fused multiply-add, and square root, with explicit
rounding modes and operation-specific exception status.
:::

:::theorem "finite_ieee_refinement" (parent := "binary32_semantics") (lean := "TorchLean.Floats.IEEE754.IEEE32Exec.toReal_add_eq_fp32Round_of_isFinite")
On the stated finite-result path, {uses "executable_binary32"}[executable addition] agrees with
{uses "rounded_real_fp32"}[rounded-real binary32 addition]. Matching bridge theorems cover
subtraction, multiplication, fused multiply-add, square root, and division.
:::

:::proof "finite_ieee_refinement"
The proof decodes {uses "executable_binary32"}[finite operands] to dyadics and identifies the
bit-level result with {uses "rounded_real_fp32"}[nearest-even real rounding].

For a composed expression, each intermediate operation must meet the hypotheses of its bridge.
Finite source tensors alone do not establish this: addition or multiplication of finite operands
can overflow before the final output is formed.
:::

:::theorem "directed_addition_lower_bound" (parent := "binary32_semantics") (lean := "FloatLib.Floats.Formats.BinaryInterchange.Model.toEReal_addDown_le")
For finite inputs, downward-rounded {uses "executable_binary32"}[binary32 addition] is no greater
than the exact real sum, including overflow to negative infinity.
:::

:::proof "directed_addition_lower_bound"
The proof decodes the finite {uses "executable_binary32"}[inputs] to dyadics, computes their exact
dyadic sum, and applies soundness of downward rounding in the extended reals.
:::

:::theorem "directed_addition_upper_bound" (parent := "binary32_semantics") (lean := "FloatLib.Floats.Formats.BinaryInterchange.Model.le_toEReal_addUp")
For finite inputs, the exact real sum is no greater than upward-rounded
{uses "executable_binary32"}[binary32 addition], including overflow to positive infinity.
:::

:::proof "directed_addition_upper_bound"
The proof decodes the finite {uses "executable_binary32"}[inputs] to their exact dyadic sum and
applies soundness of upward rounding in the extended reals.

Extended-real endpoints allow these two directed statements to remain useful when a finite exact
sum exceeds the largest binary32 value. A lower endpoint of negative infinity or an upper endpoint
of positive infinity still gives a valid one-sided bound, although it may be too wide for a later
verification claim. This differs from the finite refinement theorem, whose conclusion identifies
a decoded result with rounded-real arithmetic and therefore needs its finite-path premise.
:::

:::group "runtime_error_bounds"
Operator bounds composed across programs.
:::

:::theorem "compositional_forward_approximation" (parent := "runtime_error_bounds") (lean := "Proofs.RuntimeApprox.FwdGraph.eval_approx")
Local approximation contracts over {uses "shape_indexed_tensors"}[typed tensors] compose through
forward graph evaluation.
:::

:::proof "compositional_forward_approximation"
Forward graph induction carries every local contract through
{uses "shape_indexed_tensors"}[the stored typed context].
:::

:::theorem "compositional_reverse_approximation" (parent := "runtime_error_bounds") (lean := "Proofs.RuntimeApprox.RevGraph.backprop_approx")
Given approximate inputs and cotangent seeds, local forward and backward contracts compose into an
approximation bound for every gradient produced by reverse graph evaluation.
:::

:::proof "compositional_reverse_approximation"
Reverse graph induction reuses {uses "compositional_forward_approximation"}[forward composition]
and threads the local backward bounds through the accumulated cotangent context.

The accumulation law is an explicit numerical premise. When two graph paths reach one variable,
their cotangents are added, so bounds for the two local VJPs must also account for that rounded sum.
Analytic correctness additionally requires identifying the ideal VJP with the forward derivative.
:::

:::definition "nf_positive_division_bound" (parent := "runtime_error_bounds") (lean := "Proofs.RuntimeApprox.NFBackend.divPosErrorBound")
`divPosErrorBound η epsx epsy xhat yhat` is an upper bound for a rounded division's forward error;
`xhat` and `yhat` are the approximate operands interpreted as reals. The exact
denominator is at least `η`, and the approximate denominator is within $`\mathtt{epsy} < \eta` of
it. The bound is the sum of three terms: the numerator error scaled by the effective margin, the
denominator error scaled by the squared margin, and half an ULP of the quotient under
{uses "generic_grid_rounding"}[grid rounding]. The theorem `approx_div_nf_of_pos_lb` proves it, and
the sigmoid, logistic, and mean bounds are built on top of it.
:::

:::theorem "nf_sigmoid_bound_regression" (parent := "runtime_error_bounds") (lean := "Proofs.RuntimeApprox.NFBackend.reciprocal_sigmoid_bound_scalar_le_one")
Under explicit small-error hypotheses on the rounded one, the rounded sigmoid denominator, and the
ULP of the quotient, the error budget for the sequence $`1/(1+\exp(-x))` derived from
{uses "nf_positive_division_bound"}[the positive-division bound] is at most one. This is a
regression theorem: it pins the size of the budget so that a refactor cannot silently make it
vacuous. The public sigmoid evaluates this sequence on positive inputs and uses
$`\exp(x)/(1+\exp(x))` otherwise. Its theorem `approx_sigmoid_nf` selects the error budget for
the branch that was evaluated.

The two branches agree as real functions, allowing the exact and rounded inputs to fall on opposite
sides of zero. Their budgets still follow different rounded operation sequences, including the
numerator exponential in the nonpositive branch.
:::

:::proof "nf_sigmoid_bound_regression"
The three terms of {uses "nf_positive_division_bound"}[the division bound] are each estimated
against the hypotheses and summed.
:::

:::definition "numerical_optimizer_contract" (parent := "runtime_error_bounds") (lean := "Proofs.RuntimeApprox.Optimizer.NumericalStepContract")
`NumericalStepContract` packages specification and runtime optimizer states, their approximation
relation, an update bound, any domain checks, and the theorem that one update respects the bound.
:::

:::theorem "end_to_end_runtime_error_bounds" (parent := "runtime_error_bounds") (lean := "Proofs.RuntimeApprox.NFBackend.backprop_optimizer_update_approx_graphData")
For one parameter in an already constructed typed reverse graph,
{uses "compositional_reverse_approximation"}[the reverse approximation theorem] and a
{uses "numerical_optimizer_contract"}[valid optimizer contract] carry the stated input, seed,
parameter, state, and step-data bounds through backpropagation and one optimizer update.
:::

:::proof "end_to_end_runtime_error_bounds"
The proof obtains the indexed gradient bound from
{uses "compositional_reverse_approximation"}[reverse composition], then applies the update-soundness
field of {uses "numerical_optimizer_contract"}[the supplied optimizer contract].

The parameter tensor being updated is a separate argument from the graph context. For ordinary
training, the application chooses the tensor at that context index, so the gradient is evaluated
at the parameter value that receives the update.
:::

:::definition "checked_numerical_certificate" (parent := "runtime_error_bounds") (lean := "Proofs.RuntimeApprox.NumericalCertificate.RegistryCheckedCertificate")
A registry-checked numerical certificate retains the submitted artifact together with the
canonical source ranges, node-range trace, accepted kernel plan, and proofs that the recomputed
trace and audit match the artifact. Real-valued enclosure is a separate theorem.

This distinction separates consistency of submitted data from mathematical soundness of the range
transfer. Reconstructing the same interval twice proves agreement with the registry, but enclosure
still needs a connection to the operation's real denotation.
:::

:::definition "proved_real_enclosure_trace" (parent := "runtime_error_bounds") (lean := "Proofs.RuntimeApprox.NumericalCertificate.ProvedRealEnclosure")
For one {uses "checked_numerical_certificate"}[registry-checked certificate],
`ProvedRealEnclosure` stores a
real payload and input, the complete {uses "ir_denotation"}[IR execution trace], and a proof that
each real node value lies in its checked interval.
:::

:::theorem "checked_numerical_execution" (parent := "runtime_error_bounds") (lean := "Proofs.RuntimeApprox.NumericalCertificate.RangeCheckedExecution.error_trace")
A checked IEEE replay plus a separately supplied
{uses "proved_real_enclosure_trace"}[real-execution enclosure] for the same
{uses "checked_numerical_certificate"}[certificate] yields a graph-wide pointwise error trace whose
budget at each node is the width of its checked interval.
:::

:::proof "checked_numerical_execution"
The proof combines the IEEE replay's range check with
{uses "proved_real_enclosure_trace"}[the supplied real enclosure], node by node.

Both values lie between the same endpoints, so their distance is bounded by the interval width.
This is pointwise in the two supplied executions. A statement for every input in a region requires
real-enclosure and execution evidence quantified over that region.
