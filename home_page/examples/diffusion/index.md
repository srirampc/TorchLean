title: Diffusion Walkthrough

`NN.Examples.Models.Generative.Diffusion` follows data through noising, denoiser training, sampling,
and a saved image artifact. The model, sampler, and specification-level diffusion definitions are
all Lean code.

## Run It First

For a short runtime check, use the CUDA path with a tiny model:

```bash
lake -R -K cuda=true exe torchlean diffusion --device cuda --dataset cifar10 --n-total 1 --steps 1 --hidden-c 1 --T 2
```

For a more informative local run, use CUDA if available. The command writes a JSON loss log and a PPM
image artifact for inspecting both numbers and pixels:

```bash
python3 scripts/datasets/download_example_data.py --cifar10

lake -R -K cuda=true exe torchlean diffusion --device cuda \
  --dataset cifar10 --n-total 800 --steps 50 --hidden-c 8 \
  --log data/examples/diffusion_trainlog.json \
  --sample-ppm data/examples/diffusion_sample.ppm
```

The command is small enough to run locally, but it still exercises the full path: data conversion,
typed tensors, runtime model, sampler, and saved artifacts.

## Data: Where Images Come From

TorchLean does not decode JPEG/PNG inside Lean. Image decoding and resizing happen before Lean; the
Lean side receives fixed-layout `.npy` tensors and checks their shapes.

Once the arrays exist, Lean loads tensors with axes ordered as
`[batch, channel, height, width]`, checks their shapes and class range, and batches them. This is a
layout convention for the dataset, not a separate image tensor type.

The two dataset modes in `NN.Examples.Models.Generative.Diffusion` are:

- CIFAR-10 as $(N,3,32,32)$ arrays.
- ImageNet-style folders converted to $(N,3,64,64)$ arrays (Imagenette, Tiny-ImageNet, or any
  folder with class subdirectories).

Inside the example, the loader path is straightforward:

1. Build a labeled source over `.npy` files.
2. Load it into a dataset.
3. Create a shuffled batch loader.
4. Map pixel values from $[0,1]$ into the diffusion range $[-1,1]$.

That last step is a single call in the example code, applied to the typed minibatch after
cropping:

```lean
pure (diffusion.unitToSignedUnit unitImage)
```

`diffusion.unitToSignedUnit` keeps the tensor shape and only rescales values from $[0,1]$ to
$[-1,1]$.

## The Spec Layer: What We Mean By “Diffusion”

TorchLean keeps diffusion vocabulary in `NN.Spec.Generative.Diffusion.*`, so training code, sampler
code, and proof modules talk about the same objects.

The DDPM picture is simple enough to state before the formulas: add noise to an image at timestep
$t$, train a model to predict the noise that was added, then run reverse steps that use the model’s
noise prediction to move back toward a clean image. TorchLean gives each component a named
definition so the runtime command and proof modules use the same vocabulary.

At the center is an interface for an epsilon-prediction denoiser:

```lean
structure EpsModel (α : Type) (s : Shape) [TorchLean.Storage α] [Context α] where
  eps : Tensor α s → α → Tensor α s
```

The forward noising process is the standard DDPM formula, but written as a total tensor definition:

```lean
def qSample (sched : VPSchedule α T)
    (x0 : Tensor α s) (t : Fin (T + 1)) (eps : Tensor α s) :
    Tensor α s :=
  let αbar : α := sched.alphaBar t
  let c0 : α := sqrtNonneg αbar
  let c1 : α := sqrtNonneg (1 - αbar)
  Tensor.scaleSpec x0 c0 + Tensor.scaleSpec eps c1
```

The training objective is also named at the spec level:

```lean
def epsPredLoss (sched : VPSchedule α T) (model : EpsModel α s)
    (x0 : Tensor α s) (t : Fin (T + 1)) (eps : Tensor α s) : α :=
  let x_t := qSample sched x0 t eps
  let tScalar : α := VPSchedule.timeOfIndex (α := α) (T := T) t
  let epsHat := model.eps x_t tScalar
  Spec.mseSpec epsHat eps
```

Then the surrounding spec modules define:

- a discrete VP schedule `VPSchedule` with $\beta_t$, $\alpha_t=1-\beta_t$, and cumulative products
  $\bar{\alpha}_t$;
- two reverse samplers:

  - DDPM: a stochastic reverse step with explicit per-step noise inputs,
  - DDIM ($\eta=0$): a deterministic reverse step that reuses the same denoiser but drops the noise.

There are also “hooks” that let diffusion samplers plug into the generic dynamical-system API. For
example, the DDIM spec exposes `ddimStepSystem` and proves the step definition by `rfl` so other
theory can rewrite it safely.

## The Runtime Layer: The Model That Runs

The runnable diffusion command does not work directly with `EpsModel`. It instantiates a concrete
neural network and then uses the public data API to build training samples.

Two choices matter in the example:

1. The epsilon predictor is a residual CNN that preserves resolution
   (`nn.models.Diffusion.NoisePredictor.residual`). The training, sampling, and visualization
   path stays easy to run on a local checkout.
2. Time is fed to the model as an extra channel: when the data has $c$ channels, the input has
   $c+1$ channels. The last channel is the normalized timestep broadcast across spatial positions.

That “append time as a channel” trick is defined once in the public API. Callers provide the
leading dimensions and spatial extents; the helper returns a tensor with one additional channel:

```lean
let modelInput :=
  diffusion.appendTimeChannel [batchSize] ([h, w] : Tensor Nat [2]) x_t tNorm
```

The model is a same-resolution residual CNN sized to run as an example. The example fixes a
configuration for one image size and hands it to the public constructor, which owns the
convolution geometry, residual blocks, and seeded initialization:

```lean
def config (c h w hiddenChannels : Nat) :
    nn.models.Diffusion.NoisePredictor.Config 2 :=
  { dataChannels := c
    spatial := [h, w]
    hiddenChannels := hiddenChannels
    kernelRadius := [1, 1] }

def model (c h w hiddenChannels : Nat) :
    nn.Builder (nn.Sequential (input c h w) (output c h w)) :=
  nn.models.Diffusion.NoisePredictor.residual
    (config c h w hiddenChannels) (batchShape := [batchSize])
```

The `2` is the spatial rank, and a kernel radius of one means every convolution is a `3 x 3`
same-padding kernel. The contract is dimension-general: the input has arbitrary leading axes, one
channel axis, and any number of spatial axes. The runnable image example instantiates this with
batch, channel, height, and width axes. Its output predicts noise with the original data shape.
The source wraps the call in a short `rw`/`simpa` step so that the constructor's computed shapes
line up with the example's `input` and `output` abbreviations.

## Training: What Gets Optimized

Training is classic DDPM-style $\varepsilon$-prediction. Each step:

1. pick a real image batch $x_0$,
2. pick a timestep $t$,
3. sample noise $\varepsilon$,
4. pair `appendTimeChannel x_t tNorm` with the target noise $\varepsilon$,
5. take an optimizer step on MSE.

TorchLean makes the supervised pair explicit as a `Sample.Supervised` value. The operation that
constructs $x_t$ from $x_0$ and $\varepsilon$ is
`TorchLean.diffusion.noisedSampleFromNoise`; it is the runtime version of the same formula used by
`qSample` in the spec layer.

The helper performs the schedule lookup, noising formula, time-channel append, and supervised-pair
construction. `diffusion.noisedSample` draws the noise from a seed; `noisedSampleFromNoise` takes
the noise tensor as an argument:

```lean
let sample :=
  diffusion.noisedSample [batchSize] ([h, w] : Tensor Nat [2]) schedule x0
    (seed := runtime.seed) (step := step)
let sampleFromNoise :=
  diffusion.noisedSampleFromNoise [batchSize] ([h, w] : Tensor Nat [2]) schedule x0 eps step
```

The schedule length is part of the type. A `Schedule T` for `T` diffusion steps cannot be used
with a different timestep count, and the runnable command rejects `T = 0` before constructing its
first sample. The noise seed controls only the sampled noise; the `step` argument selects the
schedule coefficient.

## Sampling: DDIM Replay In Lean

The example uses deterministic DDIM because it is easy to audit and stable at small scale.

The reverse update used by the runnable example is `TorchLean.diffusion.ddimPrev`. It does the usual
“predict x0, clip, remix” step:

- estimate $\hat{x}_0$ from $x_t$ and $\hat{\varepsilon}$,
- clamp it to $[-1,1]$,
- recombine it using the previous schedule coefficients.

The public helper takes the current sample, predicted noise, and adjacent schedule coefficients:

```lean
let previous := diffusion.ddimPrev abPrev ab x_t epsHat
```

The sampler also produces the “three pictures” view:

- a reference image (the real $x_0$),
- a noisy image at a chosen timestep,
- a reconstruction from DDIM reverse steps starting at that timestep.

## What To Look At After A Run

Diffusion runs are easy to misread from terminal loss alone, so the example pushes you toward
artifacts: images on disk and a JSON curve log. Those files give you something concrete to compare across
CPU/CUDA, fast-kernel switches, schedule tweaks, or model width changes.

For interactive inspection, open `NN.Examples.Models.Generative.Diffusion` in VS Code with the Lean
Infoview enabled. The widgets can display tensor summaries, graph and shape views, and saved JSON
logs next to the source.
