title: Verification Bounds
---

Now let's look at what happens when we perturb a model's input. We'll compute bounds on its
outputs over an input region, starting with interval bound propagation (IBP). Then we'll try
CROWN, which can retain more information about how the outputs depend on the inputs.

We'll also check certificates exported by other tools. Each checker has a specific job:
some recompute bounds, while others only check the consistency of supplied bounds and witnesses.

## The Question

The robustness question we'll work with is:

> For every input inside a small box around the example point, can the model’s output still satisfy the
> desired margin or safety condition?

To ask it in TorchLean, we need four things:

- a model, written in the same API used for training examples;
- a lowered `NN.IR.Graph`, so verifier code can traverse named nodes;
- an input box, with lower and upper bounds for every input coordinate;
- an output property, usually a margin such as
  $\operatorname{logit}\_{\mathrm{true}}-\operatorname{logit}\_{\mathrm{other}}\geq 0$.

The common path is therefore:

1. write or import a TorchLean model,
2. lower it to `NN.IR.Graph`,
3. attach an input box,
4. run a bound engine,
5. inspect or check the output bounds.

The reusable workflows under `NN/Verification/Builtin/` keep the model, input box, output
property, and bound pass together. The same path works for generated graphs, imported weights, and
external verifier leaves.

Let's build an input box for a small MLP. We'll use `inputCenter` as its center and `eps` as its
radius, then insert the flattened `inputBox` at the lowered input node:

```lean
let inputCenter : Tensor α [2] :=
  Tensor.map cast ([0.5, 0.8] : Tensor Float [2])
let eps : α := Runtime.ofFloat 0.1
let inputBox : FlatBox α := NN.Verification.Builtin.lInfBall (α := α) inputCenter eps
let ps : ParamStore α := lowered.seedInputBox inputBox
```

The pass propagates the input box

$$[\mathtt{inputCenter}-\mathtt{eps},\mathtt{inputCenter}+\mathtt{eps}].$$

```lean
let ibp := lowered.runIBP ps
let outB ← lowered.outputBoxOrThrow ibp
```

The bound engine returns node-indexed `FlatBox` values. Each box stores a flattened dimension plus
lower and upper tensors. A sound output enclosure satisfying
$\mathrm{lo}[\mathrm{label}]>\max_{\mathrm{other}}\mathrm{hi}[\mathrm{other}]$ establishes that label
for every input in the seed box. The rounded CLI passes below calculate candidate enclosures.
Applying this argument to them requires a soundness theorem covering the graph, parameters, and
arithmetic; the printed bounds alone do not supply that proof.

## IBP: Propagate Boxes Through The Graph

Interval bound propagation assigns a lower and upper bound to each node. A sound transformer for
an operation must enclose all possible outputs of that operation when its inputs range over their
current boxes.

We can see how this works with one scalar. Suppose

$$
x \in [-1,2],
\qquad
y=3x+0.5.
$$

IBP computes

$$
y \in [3(-1)+0.5,\;3(2)+0.5]=[-2.5,6.5].
$$

For a ReLU node, the transformer is monotone:

$$
z \in [\ell,u]
\quad\Longrightarrow\quad
\operatorname{ReLU}(z) \in [\max(0,\ell),\max(0,u)].
$$

For a linear layer, the implementation bounds each coefficient-times-input product at both
endpoints and accumulates lower and upper sums with directed rounding. With a sound transfer,
every true activation is inside the box, but the box may include values that cannot occur together.

That tradeoff explains both why IBP works well as a first verifier and why it can fail to certify
true properties. It is fast, local, and easy to compose over graphs; it loses correlations between
coordinates.

## A Margin Example

Let's apply this to a classifier with two logits. To certify class $0$ against class $1$, we want:

$$
\operatorname{logit}_0-\operatorname{logit}_1 \geq 0.
$$

If IBP gives

$$
\operatorname{logit}_0 \in [1.2,1.8],
\qquad
\operatorname{logit}_1 \in [0.1,0.7],
$$

then the margin is at least $1.2-0.7=0.5$, so the box certifies the property. If instead IBP
gives

$$
\operatorname{logit}_0 \in [0.8,1.4],
\qquad
\operatorname{logit}_1 \in [0.2,1.0],
$$

then the lower margin bound is $0.8-1.0=-0.2$. The property is undecided at the IBP-box level.
The model may still be safe; this abstraction was not tight enough for this input box.

## CROWN-Style Affine Bounds

CROWN-style passes keep affine upper and lower forms instead of only interval boxes. In other words,
the bound can say more than “this node lies between two numbers.” It can be “this node is bounded by a
linear expression over the input variables.” That preserves more correlation information.

CROWN still uses IBP intervals, because nonlinear relaxations need pre-activation ranges. Forward
CROWN stores affine lower and upper forms for nodes with respect to the chosen input node. Backward
CROWN starts from one scalar objective, such as
$\operatorname{logit}_0-\operatorname{logit}_1$, and propagates that objective
back to an input-box bound.

For ReLU, the affine relaxation depends on the pre-activation interval:

- if the interval is entirely nonnegative, ReLU is exactly the identity;
- if the interval is entirely nonpositive, ReLU is exactly zero;
- if the interval crosses zero, CROWN uses a sound linear envelope.

We can ask our lowered graph for a CROWN output box. On the CLI's rounded
backends, this uses directed backward bounds for the output coordinates. Backends supporting exact
affine reassociation instead use the nodewise CROWN sweep. Either path can retain an IBP enclosure
when no affine transfer is available:

```lean
let crown ← match lowered.outputBoxCROWN? ps inputBox with
  | .ok outC => pure outC
  | .error msg => throw <| IO.userError msg
```

The result is another `FlatBox` for the output node. It need not improve on IBP. The separate
`Verification.runCROWN` API returns nodewise affine bounds when those intermediate objects are
needed, rather than only the final output box.

For a margin objective, the backward pass asks for a bound on one scalar expression, such as
$\operatorname{logit}_0-\operatorname{logit}_1$. Instead of bounding every output independently,
this lets the verifier push a
single objective backward through the graph:

```lean
let objV : Tensor α [softmaxOutDim] :=
  Tensor.map cast ([1.0, -1.0, 0.0] : Tensor Float [3])
let obj : FlatTensor α := { n := softmaxOutDim, v := objV }

let margin ← match lowered.backwardObjectiveBox? ps ibp inputBox obj with
  | .ok outC => pure (getAtOrZero outC.lo [0])
  | .error msg => throw <| IO.userError msg
```

`margin` is the reported candidate lower bound on $p_0 - p_1$ over the input box. Its semantic
guarantee has the same soundness obligations as the output enclosure above.

`backwardObjectiveBox?` is `runCROWNBackwardObjective` applied to the lowered graph's affine
context, so the caller does not rebuild that context by hand.

The model, graph, bounds, and certificate checks all refer to the same node ids and tensor shapes.

## Which Tensor Shapes Does The Bound Pass Accept?

Flattening a tensor into a box does not discard its graph shape. Matrix products promote vector
operands and broadcast compatible leading batch axes: `[2]` times `[2,3]` gives `[3]`, while
`[2,1,2,2]` times `[1,3,2,2]` gives `[2,3,2,2]`. The contraction dimensions must match.
IR evaluation, IBP, and CROWN share this shape contract. The directed backward pass bounds a
binary product's objective using its output IBP box; that fallback can lose correlations even
when the shape is supported.

Concatenation accepts any valid axis and at least two parents, including empty dimensions and
repeated parent ids. Dimensions off the selected axis must match. The backward pass splits
coefficients by parent occurrence and adds the contributions when a parent appears more than once.

Convolution transfers accept groups, dilation, asymmetric padding, and arbitrary leading batch
dimensions, with the configuration and payload checked together. The payload stores the full
input-channel axis and selects each output channel's group; it is not a packed group-weight
tensor. Its affine representation is a dense matrix over flattened input and output coordinates,
which can use much more memory than evaluating the convolution itself.

LayerNorm normalizes the whole suffix beginning at its chosen axis. On `[2,2,2]`, axis one
means two independent rows with normalized shape `[2,2]`; flattening all eight entries into
one row would compute a different function. The scale and bias must have that exact suffix
shape. Softmax value bounds likewise use the selected axis: an extent of one gives `[1,1]`,
while other extents use `[0,1]`.

The derivative engine also computes first and mixed-second LayerNorm interval transfers over
the normalized suffix, using the stored scale and a positive epsilon. Invalid shapes or failed finite
arithmetic yield no bound. Softmax derivative transfers work along any valid axis when the scalar
backend enables `supportsIdealCoupledDerivatives`; native `Float` and `Float32` leave that
capability disabled.

These rules describe executable bound propagation. The end-to-end real IBP theorem covers its
named `EngineCore` fragment. Broader operator support does not discharge the local-transfer or
rounded-execution assumptions in a certificate theorem.

## What Each Command Shows

Let's run the TorchLean examples first:

```bash
scripts/lake.sh exe verify -- torchlean-ibp
scripts/lake.sh exe verify -- torchlean-transformer-ibp --with-crown
scripts/lake.sh exe verify -- torchlean-crown-ops
scripts/lake.sh exe verify -- torchlean-mlp-workflow
scripts/lake.sh exe verify -- digits-train-certify --epochs=50 --eps=0.02 --max=100
scripts/lake.sh exe verify -- margin-report
scripts/lake.sh exe verify -- camera-box3d-cert
```

`torchlean-ibp` is the smallest graph-bound check: lower a TorchLean model, attach an input
box, and propagate interval bounds to the output. `torchlean-transformer-ibp` runs the same
workflow over an attention block and an encoder block; `--with-crown` adds the affine pass.
`torchlean-crown-ops` uses the same graph style but adds forward and backward CROWN-style affine
passes over softmax and MSE-loss operations. `torchlean-mlp-workflow` trains a classifier and then
checks robustness with the alpha-beta-CROWN path on the resulting graph. The arithmetic used by
these commands follows the same `--arithmetic native|ieee` flag as the examples.

`digits-train-certify` trains a small
sklearn-digits classifier with Python, exports weights and test examples, then immediately
loads them and runs bound and margin checks in Lean. `margin-report` checks the internal arithmetic
of an exported logit-bound report; it does not establish the provenance of those bounds.
`vnncomp-mnistfc` exercises a compact
VNN-COMP-style fully connected MNIST network/property pair. `camera-box3d-cert` checks a camera
projection certificate for a supplied finite point set by recomputing its projections and the
claimed 2D envelope expanded by the artifact's nonnegative tolerance. Eight cuboid corners are one choice of point set.

The MNIST runner labels its result `numerically_refuted`, not `safe`. It uses outward-widened host
`Float` operations to refute the unsafe output region, but that executable result is not itself a
Lean theorem about real-valued network semantics.

The MNIST workflow requires externally prepared weights and suite files, which are not bundled.
After preparing the JSON artifacts described in the
[VNN-COMP artifact README](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/blob/main/NN/Examples/Verification/VNNComp/README.md),
run:

```bash
scripts/lake.sh exe verify -- vnncomp-mnistfc \
  --weights=_external/vnncomp/mnist_fc/model_weights.json \
  --suite=_external/vnncomp/mnist_fc/suite.json
```

Typical output from the native CROWN example includes softmax bounds, an MSE-loss bound, a margin
lower bound, and the backward objective bound. The exact numbers depend on dtype and runtime flags,
but the shape of the output should look like this:

```text
[IBP] p lo = ...
[IBP] p hi = ...
[CROWN] p lo = ...
[CROWN] p hi = ...
[CROWN-backward] margin lo = ...
[CROWN-backward] margin hi = ...
```

Then check the bundled alpha-beta-CROWN-style leaf artifact:

```bash
scripts/lake.sh exe verify -- abcrown-leaf
```

Run the compact LiRPA-style JSON fixtures:

```bash
scripts/lake.sh exe verify -- lirpa-mlp
scripts/lake.sh exe verify -- lirpa-cnn
scripts/lake.sh exe verify -- lirpa-attention
scripts/lake.sh exe verify -- lirpa-gru
scripts/lake.sh exe verify -- lirpa-encoder
```

These commands are good checks when changing certificate parsing or bound-replay utilities. Each bundled
fixture names a small supported fragment, such as an MLP, convolutional head, attention softmax
block, GRU gate, or transformer encoder block. Lean checks the artifact it receives; the fixture is
evidence for the checker format and replay predicate, not a claim about every possible LiRPA
producer.

To run the fast non-interactive checker suite:

```bash
scripts/lake.sh exe verify -- all
```

## External Artifacts

The alpha-beta-CROWN leaf checker is a consistency checker for a declared leaf artifact. Vanilla
alpha-beta-CROWN does not emit TorchLean's JSON schema directly. The current path is: an external
verifier exposes or dumps terminal leaf data, TorchLean's exporter converts that data to
`abcrown_leaf_artifact_v0_1`, and Lean checks the represented part of the artifact: box nesting,
coverage of the root box by the leaves, compatible tensor dimensions, and the witness lower-bound
test. It does not recompute the lower bounds.

The checker therefore relies on the producer for the correctness of the supplied lower bounds.
It also cannot establish whether the JSON faithfully records the external verifier's output.

The witness selects one output coordinate. The checker requires its lower bound to exceed the
corresponding unsafe threshold. Mismatched dimensions and out-of-range witness indices are rejected.
The implementation lives in `NN.Verification.Cert.AbCrownLeafCert` and its shared verification
utilities.

We can try the leaf checker with the small bundled certificate, which is also its default input:

```bash
scripts/lake.sh exe verify -- abcrown-leaf \
  NN/Examples/Verification/AbCrown/sample_abcrown_leaf_artifact_v0_1.json
```

```text
[artifact] Checked 1 leaves: ok=1, bad=0
[artifact] consistent: the leaves cover the root and every leaf clears its threshold.
[artifact] The lower bounds are the producer's claims; TorchLean did not recompute them.
```

To create that schema from a raw terminal-domain dump, use the TorchLean exporter:

```bash
python3 scripts/verification/abcrown/export_leaf_artifact.py \
  --input NN/Examples/Verification/AbCrown/example_raw_leaf_dump.json \
  --out _external/abcrown/leaf_artifact.json \
  --check
```

`ABCROWN_ARTIFACT_OUT` is the TorchLean side exporter hook. Use it from a small wrapper or
instrumented external verifier to write the schema that Lean checks. The external search still owns
the branch-and-bound run; TorchLean owns the exported artifact schema and the local witness
predicate replayed by the checker.

## Verification Results

Now that we've seen the commands, let's distinguish what their results tell us:

- IBP and CROWN commands lower a TorchLean model, attach an input box, propagate bounds over the
  supported graph operations, and report the resulting margin predicate.
- Margin certificates are replayable JSON claims: the file names a graph-shaped predicate and Lean
  recomputes the margin condition.
- LiRPA-style fixtures exercise small exported bound artifacts for supported network fragments.
  They are regression fixtures for the checker API and examples of the finite objects Lean can
  reload.
- $\alpha,\beta$-CROWN-style leaf artifacts carry one terminal external-verifier claim into Lean. The checker
  validates the schema, box nesting and root coverage, tensor dimensions, and witness lower-bound comparison represented in
  that artifact.
- VNN-COMP-style examples show how a benchmark-shaped network/property pair can enter TorchLean
  while the benchmark runner remains an external producer.
- PINN, ODE, spline, and geometry examples use the same pattern outside image classification: a
  producer exports an artifact, and Lean recomputes the residual, enclosure, interval, or projection
  predicate being checked.

When a command succeeds, cite the object and predicate it checked. For example, say that Lean
accepted the `abcrown_leaf_artifact_v0_1` witness predicate for a particular JSON file, or that the
TorchLean graph IBP pass reported a margin computed for the stated input box and arithmetic. That
phrasing is more precise than saying only that a verifier ran.
