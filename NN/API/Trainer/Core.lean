# Trainer

Create a trainer from a checked model, choose its loss and optimizer, then train or predict:

```lean
let trainer := Trainer.new model
  { objective := .mse
    optimizer := optim.adam { learningRate := 0.03 } }
let y0 ← trainer.predict x
let trained ← trainer.train data { steps := 200, samplesPerStep := 16, logEvery := 25 }
trained.printSummary
trained.save "model.state"
```

`trainer.train` and `trainer.open` accept `Tensor Float` values and execute in the selected
binary32 scalar: `Float32` for `.native` or FloatLib's `ExecFloat.Binary 8 23` for `.ieee`.
Results record that selection and read the binary32 values back to `Float`.

For a different scalar, `trainer.openTyped (α := α)` keeps inputs, parameters, predictions, and
losses in `α` throughout a CPU session. Supply `initialState?` with typed state when initialization
must preserve digits beyond the model's stored seeded `Float` values. Both opening paths return
a `Trainer.Session` for programs that drive the optimizer loop themselves.

Runtime, device, arithmetic, and optimizer settings for a trainer or one training call.

Example:
```lean
-- The defaults train on the CPU in Lean's `Float32`. `.ieee` swaps in the bit-level reference
-- semantics, which is the setting to reach for when a result looks like a rounding artifact.
def settings : Trainer.RunConfig :=
  { optimizer := optim.sgd { learningRate := 0.01, momentum := 0.9 }
    arithmetic := .native
    execution := .eager
    device := .cpu }
```
-/
structure RunConfig where
  /-- Optimizer used unless a training call supplies another run configuration. -/
  optimizer : optim.Optimizer := optim.sgd { learningRate := 0.01 }
  /--
  Arithmetic semantics selected by `trainer.open` and the managed training methods.

  `.native` trains in Lean's `Float32` and `.ieee` in FloatLib's `ExecFloat.Binary 8 23`.
  Both are binary32; `Tensor Float` values are converted at the boundary. These methods reject
  `.complex`. `trainer.openTyped` instead uses its explicit scalar parameter.

  arithmetic : Runtime.Arithmetic := .native
  /-- Immediate tape execution or reusable typed-graph execution. -/
  execution : Runtime.ExecutionMode := .eager
  /-- Device used for execution. -/
  device : Runtime.Device := .cpu
  /-- Optional advanced override for provider, assurance, and VJP policy. -/

  showBackend : Bool := false

Loss used to train a model.

The output shape belongs to the model. The objective only decides how `(prediction, target)`
becomes a scalar objective; it does not need a separate input-shape index.

Example:
```lean
-- Regression scores a prediction against a target tensor.
def regression : Trainer.Objective [1] := .mse

-- Classification needs the axis the logits live on, here the only axis of a ten-class output.
def classification : Trainer.Objective [10] := .oneHotCrossEntropy 0
```
-/
inductive Objective (output : Shape) where
  /-- Mean-squared-error supervised regression. -/
  | mse (reduction : Loss.Reduction := .mean)
  /-- One-hot cross entropy over a class or structured logit tensor. -/
  | oneHotCrossEntropy (axis : Nat)
      (reduction : Loss.Reduction := .mean)
  /-- A checked TorchLean loss program supplied by the caller. -/
  | custom
      (loss : ∀ {α : Type}, [TorchLean.Storage α] → [Context α] →
        Runtime.Autograd.Model.Program α
          [output, output] ([] : Shape))

namespace Objective

/--
Lower an objective for a checked model into the runtime module definition that the trainer
instantiates.

Training mode is the default; `.eval` builds the graph that stateful layers use for inference.

def definition {σ τ : Shape} (objective : Objective τ)
    (model : TorchLean.nn.Sequential σ τ) (mode : nn.Mode := .train) :
    TorchLean.Module.ObjectiveDefinition Unit (TorchLean.nn.stateShapes model) [σ, τ] :=
  match objective with
  | .mse reduction =>
      Runtime.Autograd.Model.Layers.Seq.Objective.mse
        (model := model) (reduction := reduction) (mode := mode)
  | .oneHotCrossEntropy axis reduction =>
      Runtime.Autograd.Model.Layers.Seq.Objective.oneHotCrossEntropy
        (model := model) axis (reduction := reduction) (mode := mode)
  | .custom loss =>
      Runtime.Autograd.Model.Layers.Seq.Objective.fromLoss model loss mode

end Objective

/--
Model-independent options accepted by `Trainer.new`.

The `RunConfig` fields select the optimizer and runtime. Managed training uses the binary32 scalar
chosen by `arithmetic`, with `Float` data and result boundaries. `trainer.openTyped` uses an
explicit scalar and preserves it in the session and its finished result.
-/
structure Config (input output : Shape) extends RunConfig where
  /-- Training objective attached to this trainer. -/
  objective : Objective output := .mse
  /-- Seed used when the model is still a seedable `TorchLean.nn.Builder` builder. -/
  seed : Nat := 0

end Trainer

/--
A checked model together with its loss, runtime settings, and initialization seed.

Construct trainers with `Trainer.new`. The resulting value supports prediction, training, and model
inspection directly through dot notation.
