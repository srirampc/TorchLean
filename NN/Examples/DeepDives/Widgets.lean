# Widget Gallery

The gallery is best explored in an editor:
- put the cursor on a `#tensor_view` / `#ir_view` / `#float32_view` line, and
- Lean will render a small interactive HTML panel in the infoview.

These widgets are inspection tools for teaching, debugging, and reviewing artifacts
without leaving Lean. They are available through the dedicated widget entrypoint
(`import NN.Widgets`) so ordinary runtime and proof imports stay focused.

## RL (GridWorld) widgets

These compact panels are useful when iterating on RL specs and proofs: they let you inspect
state encodings, policies, and rollout traces in the infoview.

A synthetic training log: a decaying loss with a small oscillation, and a saturating accuracy.

Synthetic rather than recorded, because the point is to exercise the renderer's axis scaling and
legend layout, and a hand-written curve gives predictable extremes.

A four-node autograd tape computing `a * b + b` at `a = 2`, `b = 3`.
