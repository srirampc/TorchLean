# Generative Model Examples

Runnable generative and self-supervised examples. Theory-level objective semantics live under
`NN.MLTheory`; these files are where we actually load data, train for a few steps, and write logs or
image artifacts.

`Diffusion` is one public command with typed branches for ImageNet64 (default) and CIFAR-10.
