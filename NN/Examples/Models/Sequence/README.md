# Sequence Examples

This folder contains runnable sequence-model examples: recurrent networks, Transformer blocks,
causal language models, a Mamba-style model, and a small arithmetic curriculum. These examples are
where tokenization, sequence length, causal masking, recurrent state, cache-like behavior, and
generation options enter the model examples.

## Main Entry Points

- `Rnn.lean` (`lake exe torchlean rnn ...`): a small recurrent text-window example.
- `Lstm.lean` (`lake exe torchlean lstm ...`): LSTM text-window training with a time-distributed
  head.
- `Transformer.lean` (`lake exe torchlean transformer ...`): a compact causal Transformer trained
  on shifted, bucketed byte windows.
- `CharGpt.lean` (`lake exe torchlean chargpt ...`): character-level GPT training with a two-update
  smoke preset and a full Tiny Shakespeare lecture preset.
- `Gpt2.lean` (`lake exe torchlean gpt2 ...`): a compact byte-level GPT-2-style causal Transformer
  with save/reload support.
- `Gpt2Saved.lean` (`lake exe torchlean gpt2_saved ...`): load weights saved by `gpt2` and sample.
- `TextGpt2.lean` (`lake exe torchlean text_gpt2 ...`): CUDA corpus trainer with byte-level tokens
  or GPT-2 BPE.
- `GptAdder.lean` (`lake exe torchlean gpt_adder ...`): a synthetic addition curriculum for
  next-token models.
- `Mamba.lean` (`lake exe torchlean mamba ...`): compact text training for the Mamba-style state
  model.

## Why There Are Several GPT Paths

They test different pieces of the stack.

- `chargpt` is the smallest single-file character path. It is good for understanding the data flow
  and for keeping a fast sequence-model check in the runner.
- `gpt2` is the compact byte-level causal Transformer path. It supports saving parameters and
  reloading through `gpt2_saved`.
- `text_gpt2` is the larger corpus trainer. It can use raw byte tokens or GPT-2 BPE tokenizer files
  and is intended for CUDA-backed runs.
- `gpt_adder` uses a controlled arithmetic next-token task to check sequence models, optimizers,
  and generation plumbing on a tiny symbolic curriculum.

## Token And Artifact Boundaries

Sequence examples are especially sensitive to hidden conventions. The docs and command output should
make these objects visible:

- tokenizer choice: byte tokens, character tokens, or GPT-2 BPE files;
- sequence length and batch shape;
- causal mask semantics;
- shifted target construction for next-token prediction;
- generation settings such as temperature, top-k, repeat penalty, and seed;
- saved parameter paths for reloadable runs.

The generating byte models (`gpt2`, `text_gpt2`, and `mamba`) retain all 256 UTF-8 byte ids.
The BPE path reads explicit `vocab.json` and `merges.txt` files, then uses the shared
`text.VocabularyProjection` to retain the first observed ids in its 512-entry output vocabulary.
Local id zero is the unknown-token slot. Saved parameters are shape checked before sampling;
checkpoints from the former smaller byte vocabulary require retraining.

`chargpt` uses `CausalTransformer.Indexed`. Its batches contain
bounded `Tensor (Fin vocab) [batch, seqLen]` token IDs. Tokenizers may first produce
`Tensor Nat [batch, seqLen]`; `Tensor.checkIndices` validates that boundary before the model runs.
The embedding layer gathers table rows directly, and
repeated IDs scatter-add into the same weight-gradient row without allocating one-hot token
vectors. The `transformer`, `gpt2`, `text_gpt2`, and `gpt_adder` commands use the separate `oneHot`
constructor with floating-point one-hot inputs.

The training-only bucketed demonstrations and generating models use these conventions:

| Command | Context length | Byte-token convention |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `rnn`, `lstm` | 4 | byte modulo 8 |
| `transformer` | 4 | byte modulo 4 |
| `gpt2`, `text_gpt2` byte mode | 4 | all 256 byte ids |
| `mamba` | 4 | all 256 byte ids |

The RNN/LSTM/Transformer buckets demonstrate training on shifted windows. Character GPT derives
its alphabet from the corpus. Generating examples use the same tensor sampling loop for context
cropping, padding, repetition penalties, and token selection; tokenizer arrays occur only at the
text serialization boundary. Corpus schedules are indexed streams, so training does not allocate
one-hot tensors for every future update in advance.

Useful commands:

```bash
lake exe torchlean rnn --device cpu --steps 1
lake -R -K cuda=true exe torchlean transformer --device cuda --tiny-shakespeare --steps 1
lake -R -K cuda=true exe torchlean gpt2 --device cuda --steps 10 --generate 0
lake -R -K cuda=true exe torchlean text_gpt2 --device cuda --data-file data/real/text/tinystories_valid.txt --allow-small-data --steps 1 --generate 0
lake -R -K cuda=true exe torchlean mamba --device cuda --tiny-shakespeare --steps 1 --windows 1 --generate 0
```

For a save/reload check:

```bash
lake -R -K cuda=true exe torchlean gpt2 --device cuda --tiny-shakespeare \
  --steps 1 --windows 1 --generate 0 --save-checkpoint /tmp/gpt2.state.json

lake -R -K cuda=true exe torchlean gpt2_saved --device cuda \
  --checkpoint /tmp/gpt2.state.json --prompt "ROMEO:" --generate 16
```

## What To Inspect

| Artifact | Why it matters |
| --- | --- |
| Training log JSON | Shows loss over steps and records run metadata. |
| Saved params JSON | Tests the shape-indexed parameter boundary used by reload/sampling workflows. |
| Generated text | Qualitative preview of the runtime path; theorem-level claims should cite the owning spec/proof files. |
| Tokenizer files | Define the vocabulary boundary for BPE models. |
| Lean source shapes | Show batch, sequence, vocabulary, and logits dimensions at the type level. |

Sequence models also touch verification problems: causal masks, KV/cache position contracts,
tokenizer boundaries, and batch invariance. Those contracts live in the spec/proof/BugZoo layers.
The model commands here are runtime producers and regression examples; theorem statements should be
cited from the files that own those contracts.

Supervised time-series forecasting lives in
`NN/Examples/Models/Supervised/LstmRegression.lean`, although it uses an LSTM layer, because that
example is about forecasting targets from windows rather than sequence-model mechanics.
