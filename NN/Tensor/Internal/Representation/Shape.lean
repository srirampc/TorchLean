# Static tensor shapes and coordinates

This module gives the finite geometry used by every TorchLean.Tensor.Internal denotation.
A shape is an outermost-first list of natural-number dimensions. Its
coordinates are the corresponding iterated product of finite types:

```text
Coord [d0, ..., dn] = Fin d0 x ... x Fin dn x PUnit.
```

The empty shape therefore has one coordinate, while a shape containing a
zero-length axis has none. `Coord.equivFin` uses mathlib's
`finProdFinEquiv`, so linear indices follow the conventional row-major order.

The representation is intentionally self-contained. Static shape expressions
and their coordinate spaces are the shared foundation for semantics, lowering,
and native execution.

## References

The row-major grouping convention follows einops v0.8.2, especially the
reshape stages in `einops.einops._reconstruct_from_shape_uncached` and
`einops.einops._apply_recipe`, pinned at commit
`8e911db71f2e693a0c434b041180388c685ed06f`.

A coordinate of a finite shape.

Rank-zero coordinates are represented by `PUnit`. A zero-length dimension
contributes `Fin 0`, making the entire coordinate type empty.

Project a coordinate from a dimensionwise broadcast target to its source.

Each source dimension must either equal the corresponding target dimension
or be a singleton. Equal dimensions retain the target coordinate; singleton
dimensions select their unique coordinate. Recursion on the two shape lists
keeps the proof in `Prop` while constructing coordinate data in `Type`.
