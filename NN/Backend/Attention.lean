# Attention Backend Capsules

Attention is the first place where the backend-contract distinction matters in practice.

The proof-facing FlashAttention spec and every registered runtime provider use hard-mask semantics:
blocked entries have exactly zero softmax numerator. Additive attention biases are a separate
operation and are never used to encode a boolean mask.

Composed TorchLean attention path.

TorchLean owns the tape and local VJP. CUDA batched matrix multiplication evaluates the two dense
contractions, while TorchLean's hard-masked softmax supplies the attention weights. Unlike the
direct reference kernel, this implementation has the expected quadratic dependence on sequence
length.

Direct native CUDA reference path.

The implementation computes attention without materializing the score matrix, but it is not the
IO-tiled FlashAttention algorithm. Its backward kernel recomputes row statistics and is intended
for parity checks and small inputs rather than large-model training.
