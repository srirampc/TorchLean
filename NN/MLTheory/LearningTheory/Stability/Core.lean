# Algorithmic stability (learning theory)

This file defines the vocabulary for algorithmic stability: datasets as tensors, replace-one and
remove-one perturbations, empirical error, deterministic replace-one uniform stability
(`UniformStableReplace`), and IID sampling of datasets.

The goal here is to provide a small, reusable vocabulary that downstream developments can reuse.
The definitions follow the standard event-wise / test-point-wise inequalities from the literature,
stated in a way that is easy to connect to concrete algorithms and bounds.

We keep the definitions general and avoid committing to a particular hypothesis class structure:
stability is useful both for classical ERM analyses and for modern training procedures, and the
right ambient structure depends on the application.

## Scope and design notes

### Datasets as tensors

We represent a dataset of size `n` as a **length-`n` spec tensor**
`Dataset n Z := TorchLean.Tensor Z [n]`.

- This integrates the learning-theory layer with TorchLean’s core, shape-indexed tensor datatype
  (`NN.Spec.Core.Tensor.Core`) and keeps the “dataset has exactly `n` elements” invariant enforced
  by the type.
- Even though the underlying tensor representation is functional (`Fin n → ...`), we treat datasets
  abstractly: what matters for stability is that we can (a) access coordinate `i : Fin n` and (b)
  perform replace-one / remove-one perturbations.
- This file holds definitions only. Concrete bounds are proved in separate files, e.g.
  `NN.MLTheory.LearningTheory.Stability.RidgeRegression1D`.

### Measures and expectations

For sampling, we assume `[MeasurableSpace Z]` and use mathlib's `ProbabilityMeasure`:
`iid μ n` is the product distribution on datasets `S : Dataset n Z`.

/--
A dataset of size `n` with examples in `Z`.

View a dataset tensor as a function `Fin n → Z`.

This is definitional content via `TorchLean.Tensor.vectorEquiv`, and is used to:

- define replace/remove operations via `Function.update` and `Fin.succAbove`, and
- transport the standard product measurable space / IID sampling measure to the tensor type.

section Measure

variable [MeasurableSpace Z]

/--
The measurable space on dataset tensors is the one transported from the standard product
measurable space on functions `Fin n → Z`.

This makes IID sampling (`iid` below) and the standard stability definitions work without changing
their measure-theoretic content; it is just a representation choice.
-/

  (inferInstance : MeasurableSpace (Fin n → Z)).comap (toFn (n := n) (Z := Z))

theorem measurable_toFn : Measurable (toFn (n := n) (Z := Z) : Dataset n Z → (Fin n → Z)) :=
  comap_measurable _

/-- `ofFn` is measurable too, so the representation choice is invisible to the measure theory. -/

Replace the example at index `i` with `z'`.

This is the standard “replace-one” perturbation used in uniform stability definitions.

Remove the example at index `i` from a dataset of size `n+1`.

This uses `Fin.succAbove` to reindex the remaining elements into `Fin n`.
-/
def removeAt {n : Nat} (S : Dataset (n + 1) Z) (i : Fin (n + 1)) : Dataset n Z :=
  Dataset.ofFn (n := n) (Z := Z) (fun j => Dataset.get (n := n + 1) (Z := Z) S (i.succAbove j))

  exact Dataset.get_ofFn _ _

/-! ## Learning algorithms and loss -/

/--
A deterministic learning algorithm mapping datasets to hypotheses.

This is the interface needed to state stability: an “algorithm” is just a function
`Dataset n Z → H`.
-/
abbrev LearningMap (n : Nat) (Z H : Type) : Type :=
  Dataset n Z → H

/--
A real-valued loss function.

We fix the codomain to `ℝ` to match the standard stability literature.
-/
abbrev Loss (H Z : Type) : Type :=
  H → Z → ℝ

/-! ## Errors -/

/--
Empirical error (average loss on a dataset).

We write this with an explicit $1/n$ normalization so downstream lemmas can control constants.
At `n = 0`, the totalized real expression is zero.
-/
def empiricalError {n : Nat} (ℓ : Loss H Z) (h : H) (S : Dataset n Z) : ℝ :=
  (1 / (n : ℝ)) * ∑ i : Fin n, ℓ h (Dataset.get (n := n) (Z := Z) S i)

/-! ## Deterministic replace-one stability -/

/--
Deterministic **replace-one uniform stability** (a common core notion).

`UniformStableReplace A ℓ β` means that if you replace one example in the training set, then the
loss on *any* test point changes by at most $\beta$.
-/
def UniformStableReplace {n : Nat} (A : LearningMap n Z H) (ℓ : Loss H Z) (β : ℝ) : Prop :=
  ∀ (S : Dataset n Z) (i : Fin n) (z z' : Z),
    |ℓ (A S) z - ℓ (A (replaceAt S i z')) z| ≤ β

/-! ## IID sampling helper -/

section Measure

variable [MeasurableSpace Z]

/--
IID sampling: product distribution on datasets.

If `μ` is a distribution over examples `Z`, then `iid μ n` is the distribution over datasets of size
`n` obtained by sampling each coordinate independently from `μ`.

The product distribution is naturally defined on functions `Fin n → Z`; `Dataset.ofFn` transports
it to the shape-indexed tensor representation.
-/
def iid (μ : MeasureTheory.ProbabilityMeasure Z) (n : Nat) : MeasureTheory.ProbabilityMeasure
  (Dataset n Z) :=
  let ν : MeasureTheory.ProbabilityMeasure (Fin n → Z) :=
    MeasureTheory.ProbabilityMeasure.pi fun _ : Fin n => μ
  ν.map (Dataset.ofFn (n := n) (Z := Z))
