# Stability of dynamical systems

This entrypoint collects the discrete-time stability layer for maps of the form
$x_{t+1}=f(x_t)$ and input-driven systems $x_{t+1}=f(x_t,u_t)$.

The spec file states the mathematical predicates: Lyapunov stability, asymptotic stability,
exponential stability, input-to-state stability, BIBO stability, practical stability,
finite-time stability, and one-step training stability. The runtime file provides `Float`
diagnostics for concrete systems. As with robustness, the diagnostic layer is empirical unless a
separate theorem connects it to a certified bound.
