# Latent generative model theory

This entrypoint collects the proved theory facts for TorchLean's latent generative model specs:

- VAE reparameterization and β-VAE objective decomposition;
- VQ-VAE codebook lookup and loss decomposition;
- LSGAN generator/discriminator composition facts; and
- shared weighted-objective algebra connecting continuous-latent, discrete-latent, and adversarial
  objectives.

The executable model equations and the heavier probabilistic/game assumptions stay separate. These
files prove the stable rewrite and optimization facts that examples, verifiers, and theory modules
can use without unfolding the model specs by hand.
