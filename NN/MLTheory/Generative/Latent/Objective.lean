# Shared latent-objective algebra

We use this file to connect the latent generative models without forcing them into one artificial
architecture. VAEs, VQ-VAEs, and GANs make different modeling choices, but their training objectives
share a small amount of algebra:

- a base term, such as reconstruction loss or real-sample score regression;
- one or more regularizing/critic terms; and
- a scalar weight that controls the tradeoff.

Keeping that algebra in one place gives the model-specific files a common language. The VAE file can
say "β-VAE is a weighted two-term objective"; the VQ-VAE file can say "VQ-VAE is a weighted
three-term objective"; the GAN file can say "LSGAN is score-regression algebra over the same scalar
loss vocabulary."

/--
If the regularizer is nonnegative, increasing the weight can only increase a two-term objective.

This is the algebraic core behind β-VAE monotonicity in the KL weight.

If the weighted regularizer is nonnegative, increasing the weight can only increase a three-term

For VQ-VAE this is the commitment-weight monotonicity statement.
