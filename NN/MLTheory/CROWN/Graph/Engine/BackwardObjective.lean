# Objective-Dependent Backward CROWN

Forward CROWN gives nodewise bounds. This module handles the complementary use case: start from a
linear objective on an output node and propagate that objective backward through the graph, choosing
local relaxations from the sign of the downstream coefficients.

For exact scalar backends, the coefficient transformations are ordinary algebraic identities. For
rounded scalar backends, TorchLean carries intervals for the coefficients and evaluates every
coefficient product and sum outwards through `BoundOps`. This is the executable enclosure
algorithm; its regression tests compare the result with directed IBP. An end-to-end theorem for the
rounded backward pass remains separate work, as does any claim relating a host runtime's evaluation
order to the reassociated backward expression.

## Directed affine propagation

An interval coefficient `[a₋, a₊]` records all values that a mathematically exact backward
coefficient may take after the verifier has evaluated its arithmetic with outward rounding. Linear
and structural nodes preserve these coefficients. At a node without a directed affine rule, the
active objective is discharged against that node's directed IBP box.

The final conversion chooses one endpoint of each coefficient interval according to the sign of
the corresponding input interval. When an input interval crosses zero, a directed constant
correction accounts for the coefficient endpoint that was not selected.

Each element uses one McCormick plane, chosen at the interval midpoint, and the slack that the
choice gives up is absorbed into the constant term.

Turn the interval coefficients that reached the input into a lower and an upper affine form.

Each coefficient endpoint is selected from the sign of the corresponding input interval. When that
interval straddles zero, no single endpoint is valid throughout, and the one that was not selected
becomes a directed constant correction.

Objective-dependent backward CROWN bound for a scalar objective.

Given a linear objective `objᵀ * output`, this runs a backward pass that propagates the objective
coefficients through the graph, selects the relaxation attached to each node, and returns a pair of
affine bounds on the objective with respect to `ctx.inputId`.

The returned `FlatAffineBounds` always has `outDim = 1` (a scalar objective).

Backward CROWN objective lower bound with externally provided ReLU alpha slopes.

This is an integration hook for alpha-CROWN style workflows where ReLU slopes are optimized outside
TorchLean and then imported as a per-node vector in `reluAlpha`. Imported slopes currently refine
the exact scalar path. Rounded scalar backends use the directed coefficient pass; until imported
slopes carry their own rounding contract, nonlinear nodes are discharged against directed IBP
boxes.
