# Scalar soundness for α/β-ReLU relaxations (over `ℝ`)

This file proves the *operator-level* soundness facts used by α/β-CROWN at ReLU nodes:

* `phaseRelaxUpperScalar` is an upper bound on `relu` for any `x ∈ [l,u]`.
* `phaseRelaxLowerScalar` is a lower bound on `relu` for any `x ∈ [l,u]` (with `0 ≤ α ≤ 1`).

The β-phase cases (`inactive`/`active`) are exact, and the `unstable` case reduces to the
standard CROWN (upper) and α-CROWN (lower) relaxations.

/-- The phase-aware upper relaxation is sound for any phase the interval bounds actually admit.

The consistency hypothesis is what makes this true: on a claimed-inactive neuron the relaxation is
the constant zero line, which only dominates `relu` because `u ≤ 0` was checked first. -/

/-- The phase-aware lower relaxation is sound, for every slope `a ∈ [0, 1]`.

The free `a` is the α of α-CROWN: on an unstable neuron any slope in the unit interval gives a valid
lower line, and the search is allowed to pick whichever one tightens the final bound. -/
