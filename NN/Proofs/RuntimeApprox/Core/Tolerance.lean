# Tolerance

Approximation tolerances (absolute + relative).

This file defines a small, reusable tolerance object for "close enough" reasoning:

- absolute tolerance (units of the quantity),
- relative tolerance (dimensionless), and
- a nonnegative slack factor to scale the budget.

It is small and explicit and independent of any specific backend (IBP/FP32/etc.).

## PyTorch correspondence / citations
PyTorch (and NumPy) commonly expose *absolute* + *relative* tolerances (often called `atol`/`rtol`)
in APIs like `torch.allclose` / `torch.testing.assert_allclose`. Our `approxBound` follows the same
pattern, but uses `max |x| |y|` as the relative scale so the bound is symmetric in `x` and `y`.

  /-- Absolute part of the bound, which is what keeps the tolerance meaningful near zero. -/

  /-- Relative part, multiplied by the maximum magnitude of the compared values. -/

  /-- Extra nonnegative headroom. Composing two tolerated steps generally produces a bound slightly
  worse than either, and this field absorbs that without having to widen `abs` or `rel`. -/

/-- The absolute-plus-relative part of the budget is never negative.

All three tolerance fields are `NNReal`, so this is really just bookkeeping, but it is needed
separately from `approxBound_nonneg` because the slack factor is peeled off first in the
monotonicity

/-- The full error budget is never negative, so `approxR` is always satisfiable at equality. -/

/-- The budget grows when any of the three tolerance fields grows.

Monotonicity in every field is what lets a composite bound be stated with one loose tolerance rather
than tracking the exact tolerance each sub-proof happened to produce. -/

/-- For a nonnegative `eps`, absolute-only approximation is plain `|y - x| ≤ eps`.

The nonnegativity hypothesis is not decoration: `ApproxTol` stores `Real.toNNReal eps`, which clamps
a negative input to zero, and the clamped statement would be strictly stronger than intended. -/

/-- Absolute errors add along a chain, by the triangle inequality.

This is the shape of every end-to-end runtime bound in this directory: each layer contributes its
own
`eps`, and the network's error is the sum. There is no analogous clean rule for the relative term,
which is why the composition lemmas stay absolute-only. -/

/-- The relation is symmetric, because the scale is `max |x| |y|` rather than `|x|`.

That choice is deliberate. Scaling by one argument only would make the relation asymmetric and would
force every proof to fix which side is the reference value. -/
