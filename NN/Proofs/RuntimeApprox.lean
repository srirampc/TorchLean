# Runtime Approximation Proofs

Umbrella import for TorchLean's executable-runtime-to-real-spec approximation theorems.

The runtime-approximation library is intentionally layered:
- `Core`: tolerance objects and tensor/context approximation predicates;
- `Rounding`: scalar FloatLib rounding-error lemmas;
- `Graph`: forward and reverse graph composition theorems;
- `NF`: proof-relevant rounded tensor/operator backend;
- `FP32`: convenient FP32-specialized layer/MLP/CROWN statements;
- `Optimizer`: one finite-run contract for numerical optimizer updates;
- `Reductions`: error bounds for rounded-addition trees and finite binary32 schedules;
- `Scale`: optional magnitude propagation for abs/rel tolerance reporting.

Leaf modules stay available for developers working on one operator family, but public entrypoints
and CI should import this umbrella rather than listing every runtime-approximation file by hand.
