# Residual Attention Blocks

This file proves the next composition step after full multi-head self-attention:

`x ↦ x + MHA(x)`.

That residual add is the first half of a post-norm Transformer encoder sublayer:

`LayerNorm(x + MultiHeadSelfAttention(x))`.

The existing MHA theorem already proves that the attention graph's reverse pass is the adjoint of
the Fréchet derivative. Here we append the residual add as one more proved tape node, giving a
reusable graph theorem for the residual stream that is passed to post-norm LayerNorm in the runtime
Transformer blocks.

The final output of `mhaDGraph`, i.e. the projected attention result.

The literal index is intentional: `DirectReshapeAttention.ssMHA` has 14 saved values,
and the final entry is the attention output with the same shape as the input sequence.

End-to-end VJP theorem for the residual-attention sublayer `x + MHA(x)`.

This is the proved residual-stream component used by post-norm Transformer blocks. LayerNorm itself
has its own current-spec VJP theorem in `NN.Proofs.Autograd.Tape.Ops.Norm.LayerNorm`; the composed
post-norm attention sublayer and the two-sublayer post-norm bridge are packaged in
`NN.Proofs.Autograd.Tape.Ops.Transformer.PostNorm`.
