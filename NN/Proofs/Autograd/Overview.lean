# Autograd proofs: overview and map to PyTorch

TorchLean’s autograd development is split into **spec**, **runtime**, and **proofs** layers.
This folder (`NN/Proofs/Autograd/*`) is the main correctness/soundness argument for the runtime
autograd engine, written in a way that stays close to the structure of PyTorch Autograd.

## Big picture

1. **Spec layer (`NN/Spec/Autograd/*`)**
   - Defines small `OpSpec`s: each op is a pure `forward` function plus an explicit VJP
     (`backward`).
   - These are the “local backward rules” analogous to implementing a small
     `torch.autograd.Function` with a hand-written `backward`.

2. **Correctness layer (`NN/Proofs/Autograd/Core/RealCorrectness.lean` and
   `NN/Proofs/Autograd/Core/SemiringCorrectness.lean`)**
   - Proves the core adjointness law (VJP/JVP duality) for selected `OpSpec`s:
     `⟪JVP(x, dx), δ⟫ = ⟪dx, VJP(x, δ)⟫`.
   - Adjointness is preserved when local JVPs and VJPs are composed through a graph/tape.
     To conclude that the reverse pass computes the adjoint of the forward map's Fréchet
     derivative, we also need a proof that each local JVP differentiates its forward map at the
     relevant point. Those derivative facts belong to the analytic layer and carry the required
     domain hypotheses.

3. **Tape/graph soundness (`NN/Proofs/Autograd/Tape/*`)**
   - Models a dynamic SSA/DAG tape: nodes can reference any previously produced values, matching
     the “tape of nodes” view used by most reverse-mode engines.
   - Proves that the global reverse-mode accumulation algorithm is sound assuming local
     adjointness at each node.

4. **Runtime link (`NN/Proofs/Autograd/Runtime/Link.lean`)**
   - Connects the executable runtime tape in `NN/Runtime/Autograd/*` to the proved tape model by
     compiling proved nodes into runtime nodes with baked-in backward closures.

## How this compares to PyTorch Autograd

- **Dynamic graphs**: both systems support DAG structure with sharing/fan-out.
- **VJP-first**: PyTorch’s backward is VJP-based; TorchLean proofs are organized around the same
  VJP/JVP
  adjointness statement.
- **Pure semantics**: TorchLean uses pure functions and typed shapes in the spec/proof layers;
  PyTorch
  uses an imperative engine with runtime shapes and a mutable `ctx` for custom Functions.
- **Trust boundary**: TorchLean can swap “runtime semantics” (exact, rounded models, etc.) depending
  on
  the backend, whereas PyTorch executes on IEEE-754 hardware by default.
