# Replay-Buffer Proofs

These theorems certify the structural guarantees that make the runtime replay buffer safe to use:

- empty buffers really have size zero;
- zero-capacity buffers remain empty after a push;
- pushing below capacity increments size;
- pushing at capacity preserves the configured capacity by evicting the oldest element.

This is the proof layer for the "bounded FIFO" invariant used by DQN-style replay.

item and appending the new one.
