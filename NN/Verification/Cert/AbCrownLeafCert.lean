# AbCrown Leaf Artifact

Alpha-beta-CROWN (AbCrown) leaf-artifact checker.

This module checks a small TorchLean JSON schema (`abcrown_leaf_artifact_v0_1`). Vanilla
alpha-beta-CROWN does not emit this TorchLean schema directly; use
`scripts/verification/abcrown/export_leaf_artifact.py` to convert terminal leaf/domain data from an
external verifier into the checked schema.

The checker does **not** run bound propagation itself. It validates only the finite claims present
in the artifact:
- each leaf input box is nested inside the declared root input box,
- the leaf boxes together cover the root box, and
- each leaf contains a witness that refutes the unsafe threshold
  ($\mathrm{lb}[i]>\mathrm{threshold}[i]$ for some $i$).

The lower bounds `lb` are the producer's claims and are not recomputed, so a passing artifact is
consistent, not verified. The output says so.

This is useful for:
- regression testing JSON export/import paths, and
- reviewer-friendly validation of the leaf data that TorchLean actually checks.

Check that the closed leaf boxes cover the closed root box, assuming every leaf is inside the root.

Along each coordinate, the root and leaf endpoints cut the root into a grid of closed cells. Every
leaf is a union of cells, so the leaves cover the root exactly when each cell lies inside one leaf.
Coordinates on which every leaf spans the whole root are skipped. The grid is
refused, with an error, when it has more than `maxCells` cells.

Parse and validate a `abcrown_leaf_artifact_v0_1` JSON artifact.

Structural problems with the document itself (wrong format tag, missing fields, inconsistent
dimensions) throw `IO.userError` immediately. A leaf that parses but fails one of the three accepted
predicates is counted, and the reason is printed for that leaf before the summary line, because the
three failure modes call for different responses: a leaf outside the root box means the exporter
built the wrong region, a failed prune inequality means the producer's bound does not clear the
threshold, and a stale `witness_margin` means the document disagrees with itself.
