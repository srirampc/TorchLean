# TorchLean Transformer IBP Workflow

Small end-to-end workflow:

TorchLean (MHA + LayerNorm + MSE) → lower to `NN.IR.Graph` → run:
- IBP (`runIBP`)
- optional CROWN output bounds (`outputBoxCROWN?`)
- optional objective-dependent backward CROWN (`backwardObjectiveBox?`)

The example has one batch, two tokens, two features, and one attention head. On the CLI's rounded
backends, both CROWN queries use directed backward propagation and may fall back to IBP bounds.
This is a runtime integration check, not a checked model certificate.

Run:
  `lake exe verify -- torchlean-transformer-ibp`
  `lake exe verify -- torchlean-transformer-ibp --with-crown`
  `lake exe verify -- torchlean-transformer-ibp --arithmetic ieee`

CLI entry point for the transformer-IBP workflow.

This is wired into `lake exe verify -- torchlean-transformer-ibp`.

By default this command lowers the small attention/LayerNorm example to the verification IR and
runs IBP on its scalar loss. Pass `--with-crown` to also request CROWN output and objective bounds.
The separate `torchlean-crown-ops` command exercises linear/softmax and linear/MSE examples.
Missing bounds or unexpected output dimensions fail the command.
