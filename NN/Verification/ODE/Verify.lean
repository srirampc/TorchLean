# Verify

ODE enclosure verification via NN sub- and super-solutions.

This module implements the core executable checking loop inspired by arXiv:2601.19818:

Given candidate functions `u₋, u₊` with

$$
u_-(t_0)\leq u_0\leq u_+(t_0),\qquad
u_-(t)\leq u_+(t),
$$

and

$$
u_-'(t)\leq f(t,u_-(t)),\qquad
u_+'(t)\geq f(t,u_+(t)),
$$

these are the corridor inequalities used by the classical comparison theorem for enclosing a
solution inside $[u_-,u_+]$. The real theorem in `NN.Proofs.Verification.ODE.Enclosure` assumes
clamped dynamics and explicit continuity and derivative hypotheses. This executable checker
tests the corresponding interval inequalities; a bridge from these computations to the theorem
still needs interval soundness and agreement with the real corridor functions.

Executable checking pipeline:
- import corridor networks (lower/upper) from PyTorch JSON weights,
- build a derivative graph `d/dt` by structural differentiation of the IR,
- use IBP bounds to bound `u(t)` and `u'(t)` on time boxes,
- evaluate the ODE RHS on those boxes (interval evaluation),
- recursively split the time domain until all boxes verify or we hit a depth/width limit.

Simple time interval `[lo, hi]` used for recursive domain splitting.

These intervals are only used to drive partitioning of the time domain; they are not the main

An imported corridor model plus its derived-graph.

We store:

- `inDim`: expected input dimension (1 for ODE time).
