# Shared CROWN Test Helpers

Point boxes for the flattened CROWN graph engine. Generic bound-array assertions live in
`NN/Tests/Utils.lean`; keeping the CROWN-specific construction here lets other runtime suites use
those assertions without importing the verifier.

/--
The degenerate box `[x, x]` around a concrete tensor, flattened.

Guardrail tests feed a point rather than an interval because they are checking whether the engine
certifies a node at all, not how tight the certificate is.
