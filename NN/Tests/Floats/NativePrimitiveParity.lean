# Native binary32 parity: the test behind the CUDA float32 contract

`Runtime.Autograd.Cuda.Float32Contract.NativePrimitiveAgreement` records assumptions that
native `add`, `mul`, `div`, `fma`, and `sqrt` agree bit-for-bit with `ExecFloat.Binary 8 23`.
This regression harness compares selected host results with that reference; passing a finite set of
cases does not establish the universal contract or verify a GPU implementation.

Lean's native `Float32` calls host binary32 arithmetic for four operations. Core provides no
`Float32` fused-multiply-add primitive, so this harness emits reference FMA cases for
`scripts/checks/cuda_float32_parity.sh`. That script compares host `fmaf` and device `__fmaf_rn`.

Lean's `Float32.ofBits` canonicalizes NaNs, while `ExecFloat.Binary 8 23` preserves their sign and
payload
when quieting them. The native conversion therefore cannot serve as a payload-preserving oracle.
The sweep skips NaN inputs and counts them separately; `nanOracleReport` displays the conversion
behavior. This limitation concerns the host comparison, not a measured GPU result.

Run:
  `lake exe native_float32_parity`
  `lake exe native_float32_parity --sweep 1000000`
  `lake exe native_float32_parity --emit-cases`

The last form prints one case per line for the CUDA parity script to consume.

One comparison to make: a label, and the operand bits.

`z` is only read by `fma`, so the binary and unary cases leave it at zero. Carrying it in the same

The cases are chosen so that an implementation which is merely "close" fails: every one of them
lands on a rounding boundary, a signed zero, an underflow to subnormal, or an overflow. A kernel
that computes in binary64 and truncates, or that flushes subnormals to zero (a real CUDA compiler
flag, `-ftz=true`), disagrees on this list rather than on some rare input a random sweep might miss.

Triples for the fused case. A true `fma` rounds once, so the interesting rows are those where the
exact product needs more than 24 bits and the addend then cancels part of it. `modelMulThenAdd`
computes the same expression with two roundings, which is what a machine without a fused instruction
would return.

The emitted format: the curated cases, the curated fused triples, and optionally `draws` random
cases, each line carrying the bits the reference model returns.

The random part matters more than it looks. The curated list is where a reader can follow the
reasoning, but a GPU has its own division and square root implementations, and `fma` has no host
counterpart in Lean at all, so the only way to gain confidence in those three fields is volume.
