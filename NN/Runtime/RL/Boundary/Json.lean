# RL Trust Boundary JSON Loader

This module contains the JSON-lines/interchange side of the RL trust boundary. The contract itself
lives in `NN.Runtime.RL.Boundary.Core`; this file only explains how to parse a small Python-friendly
rollout schema and immediately validate it against that contract.

Keeping JSON separate matters because proof files usually need the contract/checker semantics, not
the parser or PyTorch import layer. Runtime bridges can import this file when they need external
rollout loading.

## JSON loading (one simple interchange format)

We provide a small JSON schema that is easy to emit from Python:

```json
{
  "transitions": [
    {
      "obs": <nested arrays matching obsShape>,
      "action": <nat>,
      "reward": <float>,
      "terminated": <bool>,
      "truncated": <bool>,
      "next_obs": <nested arrays matching obsShape>
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

This is one supported integration path, using a practical “lowest common
denominator” that is easy to diff and validate.

### JSON Primitive Parsers

These are small helpers used by the trust-boundary JSON loader and by runtime bridges (e.g. a
Gymnasium subprocess client).

They return `Except String ...` so they can be used from both pure loaders and `IO` code that wants
to convert errors into `IO.userError`.
-/

/--
Parse a JSON number as a nonnegative integer.

This is *strict*: it rejects non-integers (e.g. `1.5`) and rejects numbers not exactly
representable as an integer when converted through `Float`.
-/
def parseNatStrict (j : Json) : Except String Nat :=
  match j with
  | .num n =>
      let f := n.toFloat
      if f.isNaN || f.isInf then
        .error s!"RL boundary: expected integer JSON number, got {f}."
      else if f < 0 then
        .error s!"RL boundary: expected nonnegative integer, got {f}."
      else
        let u := f.toUInt64
        if (Float.ofNat u.toNat) == f then
          .ok (u.toNat)
        else
          .error s!"RL boundary: expected integer JSON number, got {f}."
  | _ => .error "RL boundary: expected a JSON number."

/-- Parse a boolean field from JSON. -/
def parseBool (field : String) (j : Json) : Except String Bool :=
  match j with
  | .bool b => .ok b
  | _ => .error s!"RL boundary: expected `{field}` to be a JSON boolean."

/-- Parse a numeric field from JSON as a host `Float`. -/
def parseFloat (field : String) (j : Json) : Except String Float :=
  match j with
  | .num n => .ok n.toFloat
  | _ => .error s!"RL boundary: expected `{field}` to be a JSON number."

/--
Parse a JSON value as a typed tensor of shape `s`.

This relies on TorchLean's JSON tensor encoding used by Python bridges.
-/
def parseTensorE (field : String) (s : Shape) (j : Json) : Except String (Tensor Float s) :=
  match Import.PyTorch.parseTensor s j with
  | some t => .ok t
  | none =>
    .error s!"RL boundary: `{field}` did not match the expected shape {Spec.Shape.pretty s}."

def parseTransitionJson {obsShape : Shape} {nActions : Nat}
    (c : Contract obsShape nActions) (j : Json) :
    Except String (Transition obsShape nActions) := do
  let o ←

    match o.get? "truncated" with
    | some v => pure v
    | none => throw "RL boundary: transition missing field `truncated`."

/--
Load a rollout file and validate every transition, returning per-transition results.

Unlike `loadRollout`, this function does **not** stop at the first bad transition. Instead it
returns an array aligned with the input JSON `transitions` array:

- `ok t` means the transition decoded and passed the contract check.
- `error msg` means decoding or contract checking failed for that transition.

This is useful for widget-style debugging where users want to see a *summary* of violations rather
than only the first failure.
