# Experience Replay Buffers

This module provides the small typed replay-buffer layer used by value-learning algorithms such as
DQN, Double DQN, DDPG, TD3, and SAC.

The design is kept modest:

- transitions are already typed (`Runtime.RL.Core.Transition`), so samples cannot mix observation
  shapes or action spaces;
- the buffer is a bounded FIFO array, which is enough for examples, tests, and simple off-policy
  training loops;
- sampling is deterministic from `(seed, counter)` so runs remain replayable inside Lean.

Prioritized replay belongs in a separate module with a priority tree / segment tree and a second
set of importance weights.

/--
Replay transition from a Gym-style observed step.

`done` is set from `terminated` alone. A time-limit truncation still has a successor state whose
value the TD target should bootstrap from, so a truncated step is stored with `done = false`. This
is the same split the PPO rollout makes between its bootstrap and continuation masks. A validated
`Runtime.RL.Boundary.Transition` is an `ObservedTransition` over `Float`, so it converts directly.

/--
Bounded FIFO replay buffer.

`capacity = 0` is allowed and represents a disabled buffer; pushes then leave the buffer empty.

/-- `true` iff the buffer has reached its configured capacity. -/
def isFull (b : Buffer α obsShape nActions) : Bool :=
  b.capacity != 0 && b.items.size ≥ b.capacity

/--
Push one transition, dropping the oldest item if the buffer is already full.

The invariant `items.size ≤ capacity` is maintained by construction when the buffer starts valid.
-/
def push (b : Buffer α obsShape nActions) (t : Transition α obsShape nActions) :
    Buffer α obsShape nActions :=
  if b.capacity = 0 then
    { b with items := #[] }
  else
    let withNew := b.items.push t
    if withNew.size ≤ b.capacity then
      { b with items := withNew }
    else
      { b with items := withNew.extract 1 withNew.size }

/-- Push a batch of transitions in order. -/
def pushMany (b : Buffer α obsShape nActions) (ts : Array (Transition α obsShape nActions)) :
    Buffer α obsShape nActions :=
  ts.foldl (fun acc t => acc.push t) b

/--
Read an item by wrapping the index modulo the current buffer size.

Returns `none` for an empty buffer.

def getModulo? (b : Buffer α obsShape nActions) (idx : Nat) :
    Option (Transition α obsShape nActions) :=
  if h : b.items.size = 0 then
    none
  else
    some (b.items[idx % b.items.size]'(Nat.mod_lt _ (Nat.pos_of_ne_zero h)))

/--
Deterministic contiguous sample with wraparound.

This is useful for tests and for simple off-policy examples where reproducibility matters more than
statistical randomness. Empty buffers return an empty batch.
-/
def sampleContiguous (b : Buffer α obsShape nActions) (start batchSize : Nat) :
    Array (Transition α obsShape nActions) :=
  if h : b.items.size = 0 then
    #[]
  else
    Id.run do
      let mut out := #[]
      for k in [0:batchSize] do
        out := out.push (b.items[(start + k) % b.items.size]'(Nat.mod_lt _ (Nat.pos_of_ne_zero h)))
      return out

/--
Deterministic pseudo-random sample from `(seed, counter)`.

The sampler intentionally returns the next counter rather than hiding mutation. It draws indices via
TorchLean's keyed uniform helper, then wraps them modulo the current buffer size. Empty buffers
return an empty batch and leave the counter unchanged.
-/
def sampleRandom (b : Buffer α obsShape nActions) (seed counter batchSize : Nat) :
    Nat × Array (Transition α obsShape nActions) :=
  if h : b.items.size = 0 then
    (counter, #[])
  else
    Id.run do
      let mut out := #[]
      let mut c := counter
      for _ in [0:batchSize] do
        let key := Spec.Random.keyOf seed c
        let u : Float :=
          Tensor.item
            (Spec.Random.uniform (α := Float) key (s := Shape.scalar))
        let idx := ((u * Float.ofNat b.items.size).floor.toUInt64.toNat) % b.items.size
        out := out.push (b.items[idx]'(Nat.mod_lt _ (Nat.pos_of_ne_zero h)))
        c := c + 1
      return (c, out)
