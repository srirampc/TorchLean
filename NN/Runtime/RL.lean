# Reinforcement Learning Runtime Entrypoint

This is the runtime umbrella for typed reinforcement-learning utilities. The modules here are
executable infrastructure: they define small MDP/bandit interfaces, value-learning and
policy-gradient helpers, replay buffers, checked rollout boundaries, Gymnasium subprocess sessions,
and PPO rollout infrastructure.

The split is intentional:
- `Runtime.RL.Core` contains tensor-shaped rollout/loss helpers shared by algorithms;
- `Runtime.RL.Replay` contains typed bounded replay buffers for off-policy algorithms;
- `Runtime.RL.Algorithms.*` contains pure/mostly-pure bandit, tabular, value-learning, and
  policy-gradient equations;
- `Runtime.RL.Boundary` records host-side rollout contracts before converting observations and
  rewards into TorchLean tensors;
- `Runtime.RL.Gymnasium` is an external-process bridge and therefore a trust boundary;
- `Runtime.RL.DQN.Autograd` contains semi-gradient Huber objectives for value learning;
- `Runtime.RL.PolicyGradient.Autograd` contains differentiable actor/critic losses over TorchLean
  refs; model architectures remain in GraphSpec/API model layers;
- `Runtime.RL.PPO` contains rollout/sample construction;
- `Runtime.RL.Numerics.*` contains optional checked float32 and interval diagnostics for RL
  recursions.
