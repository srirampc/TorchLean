# Eager Session State

The tapes and side tables shared by eager operations. Parameters own their CUDA mirrors; the
session owns recorded intermediates. Handle generations separate consecutive forward passes.

/-- The mutable cells owned by a parameter, without reading or comparing tensor elements.

Two registrations share optimizer storage only when all three cells coincide. Equal values and
equal names do not make separately allocated parameters aliases. Keeping this descriptor in the
session leaves the public `Param` record and its construction interface unchanged.

/--
Use only addresses of the mutable reference cells, never tensor data or CUDA allocations.
The index below retains each representative, so these cells cannot be freed and their addresses
reused while its key is present. Keys are local to one grouping operation.

/--
A partition hint, not an identity decision. The logical implementation puts each shape in one
bucket; the native implementation refines that partition by live reference-cell addresses.
Every candidate in a bucket is still checked by `ParameterStorage.same`.

/--
Map each present storage to its first occurrence, retaining absent slots.

A balanced tree of full-width reference keys avoids pairwise searches among independent storages.
Reference equality remains authoritative even if keys collide. Representatives retain their cells
until the operation ends; neither keys nor references are cached between calls. Consequently a
new parameter list or recording can change its alias layout without invalidating a cache.

Mutable tapes and side tables for eager execution.

`paramsByLeaf` links parameter leaves to their persistent storage. A reset drops the recording and
advances `refGeneration`, but keeps the owner id, random counter, and backend selections.

/--
Pair the result of a tape constructor with the tape to store afterwards.

On success this is the extended tape. Tape constructors fail before they append, so on failure
it is the tape the constructor started from. Call it inside the lambda passed to `recordCpu` or
`recordCuda`, as `fun t0 => keepTapeOnError t0 (Tape.op (t := t0) ...)`. There the constructor is
inlined next to the match, the compiler sees that the failure branches are the only other uses of
`t0`, and the final `Array.push` in `addNode` updates the node array in place.

@[inline] def keepTapeOnError {τ : Type} (t : τ)
    (result : Except String (τ × Nat)) : τ × Except String Nat :=
  match result with
  | .ok (t', id) => (t', .ok id)
  | .error e => (t, .error e)

/--
Run a CPU tape step on the session tape and return the new node id.

The tape leaves the reference while `op` runs, and `op` returns the tape to store back together
with the result (see `keepTapeOnError`). The tape is not used after `op`, so it stays unshared even
when this function is not inlined, which happens when the calling IO action is passed around as a
value, as in the backend dispatch.
