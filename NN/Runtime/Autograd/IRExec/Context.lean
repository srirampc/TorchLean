# Forward Execution Contexts

Node closures read tensors through a shape-indexed reader. The logical evaluator supplies a
`TensorPack`; the compiled evaluator supplies an array whose correspondence with such a pack is
proved. Array reads do not traverse the list of preceding node values. Appending is amortized
constant time when the array is uniquely owned; retaining a context or reader can require copying
the shared array on a later append.

The correspondence is a proposition, so no pack or shape-list traversal is retained at runtime.
Conversion back to a pack happens once, at the typed evaluation boundary.
