# Common

Internal helper lemmas for `NN.Runtime.Autograd.IRExec.Correctness`.

These lemmas relate the typed runtime context (`TorchLean.TensorPack`) to the untyped IR
value table (`Array Spec.SomeTensor`) and provide small building-block correctness steps that are
reused across the per-op proofs.

The lemmas are grouped as follows:

* `TorchLean.TensorPack.toShapeErasedArray` lemmas: relate the typed context produced by
  `ForwardData.eval` to an untyped `Array (Spec.SomeTensor α)` (this is what the IR evaluator uses).
* `denoteAllState*` lemmas: package the IR forward evaluator (`ForwardGraph.denoteAll`) in the form
  expected by IR-style semantic equivalence proofs.

Per-op correctness files reuse these bridges. The checked matmul-layout and axis-reduction
evaluator equations also live here so their operation proofs can use the same typed witnesses.

## Main definitions

- `throw_bind_ne_ok`: eliminates impossible success branches after `throw`.
- `NoRawLog`: side condition for theorem statements that do not carry the positivity
  precondition required by raw real `log`.
- `noRawLog_of_forall_mem`: discharge `NoRawLog` from a node-array fact, so a concrete graph can
  close it with `decide`.
- `toShapeErasedArray_getElem?`, `toShapeErasedArray_getIdx?`: optional lookup bridges.
- `evalAt_matmul_dims_ok`, `evalAt_axisReduction_ok`: `evalAt` in well-typed success cases.
- `denoteAllState_*` helpers: semantic equivalence bridges between lowered state and IR denotation
  tables.

## Implementation notes

- This module is shared infrastructure: predictable proof contracts
  matter more than clever proof tricks.
- Many lemmas here are proof-irrelevance/indexing bridges; these are repetitive but they remove a
  lot of friction from op-specific proofs.
- Collecting these utilities in one place gives op-specific correctness modules shared rewrite and
  indexing lemmas instead of repeated local proof scripts.
- These files can build slowly because they connect two representations at once: typed
  `TorchLean.TensorPack` contexts on the forward-graph side and dynamically shaped
  `Spec.SomeTensor` arrays on the IR side. Most of the cost is not arithmetic; it is Lean checking
  that shape casts, array indices, and proof-irrelevant casts line up exactly.
- When the same proof pattern appears in multiple operator files, prefer a named lemma with a clear
  contract over another local `simp` script.

## Shared side conditions

These predicates describe the exact fragment covered by a theorem. Keeping them in `Common` lets
the per-op lemmas, the semantic equivalence proof, and the chapter index refer to the same public
contract without import cycles.
-/

/--
Core semantic equivalence side condition: the IR graph contains no raw `.log` nodes.

The scientific raw-log domain is positive inputs. The IR denotation reports `Except.error` for
nonpositive values, while the pure lowered closure applies `Tensor.logSpec` to every input. The
end-to-end semantic-equivalence theorem therefore excludes every `.log` node. Protecting its input
with a positive clamp or a softplus-based construction can avoid the domain failure, but does not
discharge this syntactic predicate; that graph needs a separate domain-aware argument.
-/
def NoRawLog (g : NN.IR.Graph) : Prop :=
  ∀ i n, g.getNode i = .ok n → n.kind ≠ .log

/--
Discharge `NoRawLog` from a statement about the node array.

`NoRawLog` quantifies over node *ids* through `Graph.getNode`, which is the right shape for the
recursive lowering proof but an annoying shape for a caller holding a concrete graph. Every id that
`getNode` accepts reads an element of `g.nodes`, so a fact about the array is enough, and for a
literal graph the hypothesis is closed by `decide`:

```
theorem myGraphNoRawLog : NoRawLog myGraph :=
  noRawLog_of_forall_mem (by decide)
```

We added this because the alternative was for every user of
`denoteAll_eq_of_lowerToForwardGraph` to redo the same `getNode` case analysis inline.

If a `do`-chain begins with `throw`, it cannot produce an `.ok` result.

This lemma is used throughout the lowered-correctness proofs to close
impossible branches where lowering would have thrown an error message.

`normalizeNodeOutput` accepts a value whose stored shape equals the declared output shape and

Stating the cast with `Tensor.castShape` lets the per-op proofs compare it with the lowered closure

/--
`NN.IR.Graph.evalAt` for either axis-reduction node in a well-typed success case.

This helper records the selected reduction term produced by the IR evaluator once:
- the parent has the expected shape `s`,
- the axis validity check succeeds, and
- the node's declared `outShape` matches `shapeAfterSum s axis`.

The final cast to `n.outShape` comes from the `evalAt` "shape-tag normalization" step.

`denoteAllState` commutes with extending the SSA graph by one node (`ForwardData.snoc`).

Lookup in `denoteAllState` agrees with `getIdx` when `mkIdx pid s` succeeds.

This is used when proving correctness of the per-node lowering pass step: we translate parent ids
in the IR into typed indices into the forward-graph context.

Semantic equivalence lemma for a lowering step after the typed `nodeData` has been built.

Many operator cases differ only in how they validate parents and construct the forward closure.
Once that closure and the matching `evalAt` fact are available, the tail-of-graph argument is the
same for unary, binary, and shape-changing nodes.
