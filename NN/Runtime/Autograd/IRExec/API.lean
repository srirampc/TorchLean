/--
Lower an op-tagged IR graph into an executable `ForwardGraph`.

Requirements:
- Node id 0 must be `.input`.
- The graph must satisfy `Graph.checkWellFormed`.
- The external payload must contain entries for every `.const`/`.linear`/`.conv` node id.

This returns a `ForwardGraph` whose `eval` computes all node values in topological order. The
artifact is intentionally forward-only; it is distinct from the differentiable `Torch.TypedGraph`
used by the autograd lowering path.

This is the main API consumed by runtime callers that want executable evaluation while remaining
aligned with the shared `NN.IR.Graph` semantics.

/-- Validate an IR graph and evaluate its selected output on a shape-checked input.

Structural, declared-shape, payload, and lowering errors are returned to the caller. The input
shape is checked against node zero before execution. This evaluates the forward graph; it does
not compare floating-point results with a second semantics or assert numerical equivalence.
