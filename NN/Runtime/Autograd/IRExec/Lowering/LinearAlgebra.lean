# Linear Algebra IR Lowering

Checked lowering for matrix multiplication and payload-backed linear layers.

Both operations accept the same shapes as the IR semantics. `lowerMatmul` uses the checked
`OpContracts.matmulDims` layout for vector promotion and batch broadcasting, then applies
`NN.IR.Graph.matmulWithDims`. Linear layers preserve their leading shape and apply
`NN.IR.Graph.linearLeading`.

Each operation has a named lowerer, called directly by the exhaustive `lowerNode` dispatch.

Checked lowering for `.matmul` with vector promotion and batch broadcasting.

The shape contract supplies both typed operand shapes and the output shape. The closure calls
the same evaluator as reference IR execution, including its equal-batch typed matrix kernel.

Checked lowering for `.linear` over any leading shape.

The final input axis must equal the payload's `inDim`; every leading axis is preserved and the
affine map `y = Wx + b` is applied independently at each leading index.
