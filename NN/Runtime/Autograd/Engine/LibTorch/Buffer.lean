# CUDA Float32 Buffers

Low-level float32 tensor operations for the LibTorch CUDA runtime. TorchLean retains its tape and
selected local VJPs; native calls do not record a LibTorch autograd graph. CUDA builds use
`csrc/libtorch/torchlean.cpp`. Builds without LibTorch link `csrc/libtorch/unavailable.c`, which
reports `.notLinked` and fails every buffer operation.

Snapshot of TorchLean ownership counters and the LibTorch CUDA allocator.

`liveBytes`/`peakBytes` count logical device payloads owned by TorchLean handles. They are
not physical VRAM usage: shared tensor storage may be counted more than once, and native
temporaries or saved attention state need not have a separate TorchLean handle. `allocCount` and
`freeCount` count those payload lifetimes, not native allocation calls.

The wrapper counters track Lean external buffer objects, including empty and explicitly released
wrappers. All these ownership counters are process-wide. They help distinguish retained Lean
owners from storage managed internally by LibTorch.

`allocatedBytes`, `reservedBytes`, `peakAllocatedBytes`, and `peakReservedBytes` are the native
allocator's counters for the selected CUDA device. Reserved bytes include storage the allocator
retains for reuse; the difference from allocated bytes is not a promise of immediately reclaimable
memory. `deviceFreeBytes` and `deviceTotalBytes` report driver memory for that device. These six
device counters are zero when LibTorch is not linked. Native allocator peaks follow its own reset
lifecycle.

LibTorch owns caching policy. `Runtime.Autograd.LibTorch.setMemoryFraction` configures its
selected-device allocation
limit.

The fields are read separately. A snapshot can include concurrent allocator activity and should
not be treated as an atomic account of every allocation in the process.

Read the current CUDA allocator counters.

Each read is sequenced at this point in `IO`, including repeated calls in a loop. The native reads
stay inside the action rather than constructing a record that Lean could retain from an earlier

/--
Create a device buffer by copying from a host `FloatArray` (casts each element to float32).

This primitive has a pure Lean type, but the native implementation allocates a fresh device buffer.
Runtime code should use `ofFloatArrayIO`: each call allocates a distinct buffer, and ordinary device
exhaustion is returned as an IO error that the caller can handle.
-/
@[never_extract, extern "torchlean_cuda_buffer_of_float_array"]
opaque ofFloatArray (a : @& FloatArray) : Buffer

/--
Copy a host `FloatArray` into a fresh device buffer, rounding each element to float32.

The upload runs at this point in the IO sequence. Repeated calls with the same host array allocate
distinct buffers, so releasing one does not invalidate another. Native allocation failures return
`IO.Error.resourceExhausted`; LibTorch owns the device allocator's retry policy. The host array and
existing device buffers remain owned by the caller.
-/
@[never_extract, extern "torchlean_cuda_buffer_of_float_array_io"]

/-- Download a buffer to the host, widening each element to Lean `Float`. -/
@[never_extract, extern "torchlean_cuda_buffer_to_float_array_io"]
opaque toFloatArrayIO (b : @& Buffer) : IO FloatArray

/--
Copy a buffer to its raw float32 byte representation.

This is primarily used by streaming checkpoints. Unlike `toFloatArrayIO`, it does not widen every
element to Lean `Float`, so a large CUDA parameter can be written without constructing a second
double-precision host array.
-/
@[never_extract, extern "torchlean_cuda_buffer_to_float32_bytes_io"]
opaque toFloat32BytesIO (b : @& Buffer) : IO ByteArray

/--
Upload a raw float32 byte payload to a fresh device buffer.

Checkpoint values retain their float32 representation. Native allocation failures return
`IO.Error.resourceExhausted` before a buffer is returned. The borrowed byte payload remains
available to the caller.
-/

/-- Read a buffer size at a specific point in an `IO` ownership sequence. -/
@[no_expose] def sizeIO (b : @& Buffer) : IO UInt32 := do
  let token ← IO.monoNanosNow
  pure <| sizeWithToken b (UInt32.ofNat token)

/-- Release at an explicit token; the returned word is what keeps the call alive. -/
@[never_extract, extern "torchlean_cuda_buffer_release_with_token"]
private opaque releaseWithToken (b : @& Buffer) (token : UInt32) : UInt32

/--
Effectfully release a device allocation owned by a completed runtime scope.

The changing token makes the release depend on the surrounding `IO` sequence. `Buffer` values are
copyable Lean references to one native allocation, so release invalidates every raw alias and Lean's
type system does not establish unique ownership. Callers must enforce that no alias remains usable;
removing one cache reference is insufficient when a tape still retains the same buffer. Parameter
mirrors and their recorded snapshots therefore use ordinary Lean reference counting. Pure CUDA
formulas that retire an owned intermediate use `releaseThen`, which threads cleanup through the
returned buffer.
-/
@[no_expose] def releaseIO (b : @& Buffer) : IO UInt32 := do
  let token ← IO.monoNanosNow
  pure <| releaseWithToken b (UInt32.ofNat token)

/--
Release `workspace` and return `keep`.

This exists for pure CUDA tape code: because the returned buffer is used downstream, Lean cannot
erase the native release call as dead code.
-/
@[never_extract, extern "torchlean_cuda_buffer_release_then"]
opaque releaseThen (workspace keep : @& Buffer) : Buffer

/--
Release a collection of workspace buffers and return `keep`.

Many CUDA tape formulas create a group of intermediate buffers, then continue with one final result
buffer. Threading cleanup through the result keeps ownership local to the formula and avoids waiting
for external-object finalizers in long training loops.
-/
def releaseManyThen (workspace : Array Buffer) (keep : @& Buffer) : Buffer :=
  workspace.foldr (fun b acc => releaseThen b acc) keep

/--
A CUDA result together with workspace buffers that were needed to compute it.

This is the common ownership shape for eager CUDA formulas.  Some forward computations need
intermediate buffers again during the backward pass, so the tape keeps those buffers on the node
and releases them when the node is retired.  Backward formulas use the same shape when they
recompute a value only to differentiate through it.

/--
Collect unused host allocator pages while retaining CUDA buffers for reuse.

Training and evaluation call this after retiring a completed tape and its temporary gradients.
LibTorch retains its reusable device cache. Live parameters and optimizer state remain owned
by their sessions.

/-- Allocate a length-`n` buffer filled with zeros. -/
@[never_extract, extern "torchlean_cuda_buffer_zeros"]
opaque zeros (n : UInt32) : Buffer

/--
Allocate a fresh zero-filled buffer inside `IO` code.

The allocation runs at this point in the IO sequence. Native allocation failures return
`IO.Error.resourceExhausted`, so a caller can release its temporary buffers and try a smaller
allocation. LibTorch owns the device allocator's retry policy. Existing live buffers remain owned
by their callers, and a failed allocation adds no live buffer to the counters.

The allocating IO constructors share this error boundary. Pure allocation and kernel primitives
have their own native failure policy.

as in `zerosIO`.

### Deterministic RNG (device-side)

These are low-level building blocks used by TorchLean's seeded RNG ops (`rand_uniform`,
`bernoulli_mask`) when running on the eager CUDA backend.

They use the same SplitMix64-style mixing as `TorchLean.Random` so results are
deterministic given `(seed, counter)` and a row-major linear index.
-/

/-- Deterministic `U[0,1)` generator: returns a length-`n` buffer (float32) keyed by `key`. -/
@[never_extract, extern "torchlean_cuda_buffer_rand_uniform"]
opaque randUniform (n : UInt32) (key : UInt64) : Buffer

/--
Generate the deterministic values of `randUniform` in a fresh buffer.

The key determines the values; repeated calls still allocate distinct buffers. Native allocation
failures return `IO.Error.resourceExhausted`, as in `zerosIO`.
-/
@[never_extract, extern "torchlean_cuda_buffer_rand_uniform_io"]
opaque randUniformIO (n : UInt32) (key : UInt64) : IO Buffer

/-- Deterministic `{0,1}` mask generator: returns a length-`n` buffer keyed by `key`. -/
@[never_extract, extern "torchlean_cuda_buffer_bernoulli_mask"]
opaque bernoulliMask (n : UInt32) (keepProb : Float) (key : UInt64) : Buffer

/--
Generate the deterministic mask of `bernoulliMask` in a fresh buffer.

The probability and key retain the pure primitive's meaning. Each call allocates independently,
with the allocation error boundary of `zerosIO`.
-/
@[never_extract, extern "torchlean_cuda_buffer_bernoulli_mask_io"]
opaque bernoulliMaskIO (n : UInt32) (keepProb : Float) (key : UInt64) : IO Buffer

@[never_extract, extern "torchlean_cuda_buffer_abs_bwd"]
opaque absBwd (x dLdy : @& Buffer) : Buffer

/-- Elementwise `sqrt (max x 0)`, matching `Tensor.sqrtSpec`.

Negative inputs and either signed zero return positive zero. NaN inputs remain NaN; the clamp
uses the same ordered comparison as the floating-point maximum in the tensor spec. -/
@[never_extract, extern "torchlean_cuda_buffer_sqrt"]
opaque sqrt (b : @& Buffer) : Buffer

/--
Backward for `sqrt`.

@[never_extract, extern "torchlean_cuda_buffer_exp"]
opaque exp (b : @& Buffer) : Buffer

/--
Elementwise sine of angles in radians, returning a new float32 buffer.

The native implementation uses `at::sin`. The input is borrowed, so the tape can
retain it for the cosine factor in the backward pass.
-/
@[never_extract, extern "torchlean_cuda_buffer_sin"]
opaque sin (b : @& Buffer) : Buffer

Elementwise cosine of angles in radians, returning a new float32 buffer and borrowing its input.

@[never_extract, extern "torchlean_cuda_buffer_clamp"]
opaque clamp (b : @& Buffer) (lo hi : Float) : Buffer

/--
Backward for `clamp`.

Uses the TorchLean convention: derivative is `1` strictly inside `(lo, hi)`, else `0`.
-/

@[never_extract, extern "torchlean_cuda_buffer_max"]
opaque max (a b : @& Buffer) : Buffer

/--
Backward for `max`, returning `(dA, dB)`.

Tie-breaking follows the spec: when `a = b`, split upstream gradient evenly (`0.5`) between both.
-/
@[never_extract, extern "torchlean_cuda_buffer_max_bwd"]

Backward for `min`, returning `(dA, dB)`.

Tie-breaking follows the spec: when `a = b`, split upstream gradient evenly (`0.5`) between both.

opaque minBwd (a b dLdy : @& Buffer) : Buffer × Buffer

/-- Pointwise division of two equal-length CUDA buffers. -/
@[never_extract, extern "torchlean_cuda_buffer_div"]
opaque div (a b : @& Buffer) : Buffer

/--
Keep values where the equal-length mask is nonzero and select zero elsewhere.

Selection discards nonfinite values in blocked entries; multiplication by the mask would not.
A NaN mask is nonzero, matching the numerical backend's boolean conversion.

@[never_extract, extern "torchlean_cuda_buffer_relu_bwd"]
opaque reluBwd (x dLdy : @& Buffer) : Buffer

/--
Elementwise logistic sigmoid through `at::sigmoid`, returning a new float32 buffer.

The input is borrowed; TorchLean's tape owns the `y * (1 - y)` derivative. Values follow ATen's
float32 rounding and saturation, including zero when the negative-tail exponential overflows.
-/
@[never_extract, extern "torchlean_cuda_buffer_sigmoid"]
opaque sigmoid (x : @& Buffer) : Buffer

/--
Elementwise hyperbolic tangent through `at::tanh`, returning a new float32 buffer.

Direct evaluation avoids cancellation near zero and preserves signed zero. The input is borrowed;
TorchLean's tape owns the `1 - y * y` derivative.

opaque sub (a b : @& Buffer) : Buffer

/-- Elementwise multiplication (sizes must match). -/
@[never_extract, extern "torchlean_cuda_buffer_mul"]
opaque mul (a b : @& Buffer) : Buffer

/--
Multiply each element by a scalar `c` (host `Float`, cast to float32).

This is a primitive building block for many ops (e.g. scaling gradients).
-/
@[never_extract, extern "torchlean_cuda_buffer_scale"]
opaque scale (b : @& Buffer) (c : Float) : Buffer

/-- Device-to-device copy, implemented as a scale-by-one kernel. -/
def copy (b : @& Buffer) : Buffer :=
  scale b 1.0

/--
Copy a buffer and release the source after the copy has been produced.

The native operation creates the destination before it retires the source, so the compiler cannot
reorder the two lifetime events. Use this at ownership-transfer boundaries in the sparse CUDA tape.
-/
@[never_extract, extern "torchlean_cuda_buffer_copy_and_release"]
opaque copyAndRelease (b : @& Buffer) : Buffer

/--
Fused multiply-add: `a + c * b` (sizes must match; `c` is a host `Float`, cast to float32).

This is the classic BLAS-style `axpy` primitive and is useful for optimizers and bias-like updates.
-/
@[never_extract, extern "torchlean_cuda_buffer_axpy"]
opaque axpy (a b : @& Buffer) (c : Float) : Buffer

/--
Perform one Adam-family update through LibTorch tensor operations.

The result is `(parameters, firstMoment, secondMoment)`. Passing `decay = 0` gives Adam; passing
`decay = -(learningRate * weightDecay)` gives AdamW's decoupled parameter decay. The caller
computes the two bias-correction scales from the step counter, exactly as in `Optim.Adam.update`
and `Optim.AdamW.update`.

The caller must validate that `epsilon` remains finite and positive after conversion to float32.
The native eager optimizer and its checkpoint reader share that validation.

TorchLean's optimizer definitions specify the update. The native bridge evaluates the pointwise
expressions and returns the updated parameter and moment buffers.

/--
Scaled product exponential: `exp((c * x) * y)`.

LibTorch evaluates the two multiplications followed by the exponential. `c` is a host `Float`
cast to float32; `x` and `y` are equal-length buffers.
