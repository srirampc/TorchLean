# LibTorch CUDA Runtime Controls

Effectful configuration and readback for TorchLean's LibTorch bridge. Configure these process-wide
settings before concurrent runtime work. They are runtime requests, not numerical proof evidence:
IEEE precision and strict determinism do not establish a reference reduction order, correct
rounding of every operation, or FloatLib bit agreement.

TorchLean owns its tape and selected local VJPs. These controls never enable LibTorch autograd.
Native tensors retain their supported hardware dtypes; this API does not select arbitrary FloatLib
formats. `version` reports the linked native build rather than a version assumed by Lean.

The raw ABI uses setting IDs 0–8: TF32 matmul, TF32 cuDNN convolution, strict determinism, cuDNN
benchmarking, flash SDP, efficient SDP, math SDP, cuDNN SDP, and cuDNN enablement. Public callers
use the typed operations below. Setting and memory-fraction reads, like configuration requests,
return native failures through `IO`. Boolean settings are read back to detect a rejected request.
Without LibTorch linked, reads return zero and configuration requests fail; raw setting reads
also reject unknown IDs.

Select the device for subsequent bridge work.

The native setter rejects changes while any buffer wrappers remain live, including released or

/--
Request strict deterministic execution, or disable that request.

Enabling this requires native errors for unsupported deterministic operations, not warnings,
and disables cuDNN benchmarking. It does not fix a particular reduction tree or promise agreement
across builds or devices. Keep it stable between an attention forward call and its backward call.

@[no_expose] def getSDPEnabled (backend : SDPBackend) : IO Bool :=

/--
Permit or disable an SDP implementation.

Permission does not guarantee support for a shape, dtype, device, or mask. These choices apply to
the native SDP route. Disabling all
eligible choices causes a native execution error. Configure them before recording attention work.

Read the selected device's allocator memory fraction.

This is a native allocator limit, not the fraction of memory currently free or a cache-only budget.
Returns zero when LibTorch is not linked.

  pure fraction

/--
Set the selected device's allocator memory fraction to a finite value in `(0, 1]`.

This configures native allocation policy; it does not release live tensors or reserve memory against
other processes. Read back with `getMemoryFraction`; byte granularity may affect the observed limit.

@[no_expose] def synchronize : IO Unit :=
  synchronizeRaw 0

/--
Release unused native allocator cache blocks.

Live tensors, saved forward state, and library workspaces remain allocated. A cuBLAS workspace can
outlive every TorchLean buffer, so both allocated and reserved bytes may remain after this call.
Use the buffer ownership counters to distinguish those allocations from retained TorchLean owners.
