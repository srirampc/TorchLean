# LibTorch backend for eager execution

This umbrella collects TorchLean's LibTorch adapter, currently targeting CUDA devices.

The modules separate native execution from the tape and proof-facing contracts:

- `Trusted` and `Buffer` expose the opaque FFI buffer type and allocation/copy primitives.
- `Controls` exposes precision, determinism, SDP, device, allocator, and version controls.
- `Kernels`, `ConvPool`, and `DGemm` declare the LibTorch CUDA entrypoints.
- `Tape` and `Ops` build the CUDA reverse-mode tape over those buffers.
- `Float32Contract` and `KernelSpec` state the proof layer reference contracts for native bits.

The LibTorch bridge executes without recording a LibTorch autograd graph. TorchLean keeps tape
traversal and selected local VJPs. Lean proves the pure specs and graph-level connections; runtime
controls and tests do not prove the compiled native implementation.
