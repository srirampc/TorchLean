# CUDA Float32 Buffers

Low-level buffer operations for the native CUDA autograd runtime. CUDA builds use
`csrc/cuda/tensor/torchlean_cuda_tensor.cu`; ordinary CPU builds link the parity implementation in
`csrc/cuda/tensor/torchlean_cuda_tensor_stub.c` so that the same runtime interfaces remain testable.

### Deterministic Reductions Mode

TorchLean's CUDA runtime uses `atomicAdd` in a few kernels to accumulate float32 results. This is
fast, but floating-point addition is non-associative, and CUDA does not fix a global order for the
interleaving of atomic updates. As a result, some kernels can be bit-nondeterministic across runs.

TorchLean therefore exposes an opt-in deterministic mode that replaces those atomic accumulation
paths with fixed-order reductions. This trades performance for reproducibility.

This flag is a *runtime* setting affecting only the CUDA/stub backends; it has no effect on the
pure Lean Spec.

/--
Enable/disable deterministic reductions mode as an `IO` action.

The native setter runs at this point in `IO` and reports the resulting setting. Checking that value
both verifies the request and keeps the native effect attached to the action. Throws if the runtime
reports a different setting.

/--
Query whether deterministic reductions mode is enabled.

The read runs inside `IO`, so each call observes the current setting. A pure definition could retain
the value read during module initialization even after `setDeterministicReductions` changes it.

private opaque allocatorCacheCapBytesRaw (u : UInt32) : UInt64

/--
Snapshot of the CUDA buffer allocator.

`liveBytes`/`peakBytes` count device or stub payloads allocated by this runtime layer. The wrapper
counters track Lean external buffer objects, including empty wrappers and wrappers whose payloads
were explicitly released. In a steady workload, `wrapperAllocCount - wrapperFinalizeCount` should
remain bounded. `deviceFreeBytes` and `deviceTotalBytes` come from `cudaMemGetInfo` in the CUDA
build and are `0` in the CPU stub. Together these fields distinguish payload leaks, wrapper-lifetime
leaks, and broader CUDA memory pressure or fragmentation.

`allocCount` and `freeCount` count buffer payload lifetimes, including reuse. They do not count
calls to `cudaMalloc` and `cudaFree`. Live kernel workspace is outside these payload counters.

`cacheBytes` counts unused tensor buffers and kernel workspaces retained for reuse. Their combined
budget is `cacheCapBytes`, which defaults to 1 GiB. `TORCHLEAN_CUDA_CACHE_CAP_BYTES` can override
that budget; an explicit `0` selects unbounded caching, and invalid values use the default. Both
cache fields are `0` in the CPU stub, which keeps no cache.

The fields are read separately. A snapshot can include concurrent allocator activity and should
not be treated as an atomic account of every allocation in the process.

/--
Create a device buffer by copying from a host `FloatArray` (casts each element to float32).

This primitive has a pure Lean type, but the native implementation allocates a fresh device buffer.
Runtime code should use `ofFloatArrayIO`: each call allocates a distinct buffer, and ordinary device
exhaustion is returned as an IO error that the caller can handle.
-/
@[never_extract, extern "torchlean_cuda_buffer_of_float_array"]
opaque ofFloatArray (a : @& FloatArray) : Buffer

/--
Copy a host `FloatArray` into a fresh device buffer, rounding each element to float32.

The upload runs at this point in the IO sequence. Repeated calls with the same host array allocate
distinct buffers, so releasing one does not invalidate another. If device allocation fails, the
allocator releases unused cached blocks and retries; a second OOM throws
`IO.Error.resourceExhausted`. The host array and existing device buffers remain owned by the caller.
-/

@[never_extract, extern "torchlean_cuda_buffer_to_float_array_io"]
opaque toFloatArrayIO (b : @& Buffer) : IO FloatArray

/--
Copy a buffer to its raw float32 byte representation.

This is primarily used by streaming checkpoints. Unlike `toFloatArrayIO`, it does not widen every
element to Lean `Float`, so a large CUDA parameter can be written without constructing a second
double-precision host array.
-/
@[never_extract, extern "torchlean_cuda_buffer_to_float32_bytes_io"]
opaque toFloat32BytesIO (b : @& Buffer) : IO ByteArray

/--
Upload a raw float32 byte payload to a fresh device buffer.

Checkpoint values retain their float32 representation. Device allocation uses the same cache
reclamation and retry as `zerosIO`; ordinary device exhaustion throws `IO.Error.resourceExhausted`
before a buffer is returned. The borrowed byte payload remains available to the caller.

@[never_extract, extern "torchlean_cuda_buffer_size"]
opaque size (b : @& Buffer) : UInt32

/-- Element count read at an explicit token; `sizeIO` supplies a changing one. -/

@[never_extract, extern "torchlean_cuda_buffer_release_with_token"]
private opaque releaseWithToken (b : @& Buffer) (token : UInt32) : UInt32

/--
Effectfully release a device allocation owned by a completed runtime scope.

The changing token makes the release depend on the surrounding `IO` sequence. `Buffer` values are
copyable Lean references to one native allocation, so release invalidates every raw alias and Lean's
type system does not establish unique ownership. Callers must enforce that no alias remains usable;
removing one cache reference is insufficient when a tape still retains the same buffer. Parameter
mirrors and their recorded snapshots therefore use ordinary Lean reference counting. Pure CUDA
formulas that retire an owned intermediate use `releaseThen`, which threads cleanup through the
returned buffer.
-/
@[no_expose] def releaseIO (b : @& Buffer) : IO UInt32 := do
  let token ← IO.monoNanosNow
  pure <| releaseWithToken b (UInt32.ofNat token)

/--
Release `workspace` and return `keep`.

This exists for pure CUDA tape code: because the returned buffer is used downstream, Lean cannot
erase the native release call as dead code.
-/
@[never_extract, extern "torchlean_cuda_buffer_release_then"]
opaque releaseThen (workspace keep : @& Buffer) : Buffer

/--
Release a collection of workspace buffers and return `keep`.

Many CUDA tape formulas create a group of intermediate buffers, then continue with one final result
buffer. Threading cleanup through the result keeps ownership local to the formula and avoids waiting
for external-object finalizers in long training loops.
-/
def releaseManyThen (workspace : Array Buffer) (keep : @& Buffer) : Buffer :=
  workspace.foldr (fun b acc => releaseThen b acc) keep

/--
A CUDA result together with workspace buffers that were needed to compute it.

This is the common ownership shape for eager CUDA formulas.  Some forward computations need
intermediate buffers again during the backward pass, so the tape keeps those buffers on the node
and releases them when the node is retired.  Backward formulas use the same shape when they
recompute a value only to differentiate through it.

/-- Native collection mode: zero keeps reusable CUDA blocks; one drains all unused caches. -/
@[never_extract, extern "torchlean_runtime_collect_allocator"]
private opaque collectAllocatorRaw (force : UInt32) : UInt32

/--
Collect unused host allocator pages while retaining CUDA buffers for reuse.

Training and evaluation call this after retiring a completed tape and its temporary gradients.
The native cache budget bounds retained device memory, so ordinary callers do not need to flush
the cache between updates. Live parameters and optimizer state remain owned by their sessions.
-/
@[no_expose] def collectGarbage : IO Unit := do
  let collected ← IO.lazyPure fun _ => collectAllocatorRaw 0
  if collected == 0 then
    throw <| IO.userError "CUDA allocator collection failed"

/--
Return all unused tensor buffers and kernel workspaces to the CUDA driver.

This explicit operation waits for cached blocks to become safe to free and also asks the host
allocator to release unused pages. It does not release live tensors, parameter mirrors, or optimizer
state. Normal training retains a bounded cache automatically; use this when returning unused memory
to another workload matters more than keeping it for the next operation.

Every invocation performs a fresh collection, including calls after an earlier flush. The raw call
stays inside the `IO` action so repeated requests cannot share a previously computed result.
-/
@[no_expose] def emptyCache : IO Unit := do
  let collected ← IO.lazyPure fun _ => collectAllocatorRaw 1

/-- Allocate a length-`n` buffer filled with zeros. -/
@[never_extract, extern "torchlean_cuda_buffer_zeros"]
opaque zeros (n : UInt32) : Buffer

/--
Allocate a fresh zero-filled buffer inside `IO` code.

The allocation runs at this point in the IO sequence. If device memory is exhausted, the native
allocator first releases unused cached blocks and retries. A second device OOM throws
`IO.Error.resourceExhausted`, so a caller can release its own temporary buffers and try a smaller
allocation. Existing live buffers remain owned by their callers, and a failed allocation adds no
live buffer to the counters.

The allocating IO constructors share this recovery behavior. Pure allocation and kernel primitives
retain their native failure policy. Host allocation failure and errors encountered while flushing
an invalid CUDA context are outside this recovery path.

@[never_extract, extern "torchlean_cuda_buffer_full"]
opaque full (n : UInt32) (v : Float) : Buffer

/--
Allocate a fresh length-`n` buffer filled with `v`, rounded to float32.

Each call owns a distinct buffer. Device allocation follows the cache reclamation and retry used
by `zerosIO`, and ordinary device exhaustion throws `IO.Error.resourceExhausted`.

### Deterministic RNG (device-side)

These are low-level building blocks used by TorchLean's seeded RNG ops (`rand_uniform`,
`bernoulli_mask`) when running on the eager CUDA backend.

They use the same SplitMix64-style mixing as `TorchLean.Random` so results are
deterministic given `(seed, counter)` and a row-major linear index.

@[never_extract, extern "torchlean_cuda_buffer_rand_uniform"]
opaque randUniform (n : UInt32) (key : UInt64) : Buffer

/--
Generate the deterministic values of `randUniform` in a fresh buffer.

The key determines the values; repeated calls still allocate distinct buffers. Device allocation
uses the recovery behavior of `zerosIO`, including `IO.Error.resourceExhausted` on ordinary OOM.

opaque bernoulliMask (n : UInt32) (keepProb : Float) (key : UInt64) : Buffer

Generate the deterministic mask of `bernoulliMask` in a fresh buffer.

The probability and key retain the pure primitive's meaning. Each call allocates independently,
using the cache reclamation, retry, and ordinary device-OOM error of `zerosIO`.

Backward for `sqrt`.

Elementwise sine of angles in radians, returning a new float32 buffer.

The native implementation applies `sinf` to each entry. The input is borrowed, so the tape can
retain it for the cosine factor in the backward pass.

Tie-breaking follows the spec: when `a = b`, split upstream gradient evenly (`0.5`) between both.

Copy a buffer and release the source after the copy has been produced.

The native operation creates the destination before it retires the source, so the compiler cannot
reorder the two lifetime events. Use this at ownership-transfer boundaries in the sparse CUDA tape.

opaque copyAndRelease (b : @& Buffer) : Buffer

/--
Fused multiply-add: `a + c * b` (sizes must match; `c` is a host `Float`, cast to float32).

This is the classic BLAS-style `axpy` primitive and is useful for optimizers and bias-like updates.

Perform one Adam-family update in a single CUDA pass.

The result is `(parameters, firstMoment, secondMoment)`. Passing `decay = 0` gives Adam; passing
`decay = -(learningRate * weightDecay)` gives AdamW's decoupled parameter decay. The caller
computes the two bias-correction scales from the step counter, exactly as in `Optim.Adam.update`
and `Optim.AdamW.update`.

This primitive changes only the execution plan. TorchLean's optimizer definitions remain the
semantic reference, while this native boundary avoids materializing every intermediate tensor in
the pointwise update.

Scaled product exponential: `exp((c * x) * y)`, a single fused device kernel with one launch and
one result buffer instead of the four elementwise ops (`full c`, two `mul`s, `exp`) of the

propagation two-way extinction `exp(-2 * κ * ℓ)` in computational electromagnetism and radar/optical
remote sensing, or a Boltzmann-type weight `exp(-β * E * s)`. Fusing the exponential with its scaled
product is the hot inner form in those forward models.
