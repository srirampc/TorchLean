# Batch mapping

A backend-independent recursion for applying an operation pointwise over the outer axis of a
shape-typed reference. Eager and typed graph execution supply their own slicing, reshaping, and
concatenation operations; the traversal itself remains shared.

/--
Apply a reference-level operation independently to every entry of a leading axis.

The callbacks isolate the four structural operations needed by the recursion. Device backends may
replace this reference traversal with a fused primitive when the fused operation has the same
per-entry semantics.

The axis is split in half and each half is mapped recursively, so `f` still runs on entries
`0, ..., n - 1` in order while every entry is sliced and concatenated once per level of a balanced
tree. Peeling one entry at a time would copy the remaining tail at every step.
