# Spec reinforcement learning

Umbrella import for RL environments and MDP specifications.

The files here keep transition systems, rewards, and policy-facing environment contracts separate
from runtime training code, so RL examples can be checked against a small pure semantics.

Folder map:

- `Core`: Bellman/TD/return/GAE algebra over shape-indexed trajectories.
- `Environment`: a pure Gymnasium-style environment contract with explicit latent state.
- `MDP`: deterministic finite MDPs over `Fin n` states/actions and tensor value tables.
- `FiniteStochasticMDP`: finite stochastic MDPs with row-stochastic tensor transition kernels.
- `MarkovMDP`: measure-theoretic MDPs over measurable spaces using mathlib Markov kernels.
- `Envs/GridWorld`: a concrete finite environment plus deterministic/stochastic MDP views.

The names `MDP`, `ValueFunction`, and `bellmanPolicy` appear in multiple namespaces on purpose:
`Spec.RL` for deterministic finite MDPs, `Spec.RL.FiniteStochastic` for finite stochastic MDPs, and
`Spec.RL.Markov` for measurable-space MDPs. Keeping these layers separate avoids forcing every RL
development into the heaviest probability-theory abstraction.
