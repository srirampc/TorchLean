# Random Forest

Forests aggregate tree predictions by majority vote for classification or by an arithmetic mean
for regression. `Forest` stores symbolic decision trees; `Numeric` fits typed CART trees to tensors.

Numeric training draws a bootstrap sample of rows for each tree, with replacement. An explicit seed
makes those draws reproducible. A separate stream selects candidate features without replacement at
each split when `maxFeatures` is smaller than the input width. The default considers every feature.

These are standalone reference models with targeted executable tests. No API builder or
model-correctness theorem is provided here.

/--
A forest is just an array of trees. The count is a runtime value, not a type index, because nothing
in the aggregation depends on how many trees there are.

The container leaves training and label semantics to its caller. Numeric training below has a
separate typed representation whose feature count and depth are recorded in each tree's type.

  /-- The trees, in the order they were grown. -/
  trees : Array (DecisionTree α)

/--
Predict by evaluating every tree and folding the results with a caller-supplied aggregation.

The aggregation is a parameter rather than a field of `Forest` because the same grown forest answers
a classification question with `majorityVote` and a regression question with `average`, and a spec
should not force a choice the caller has not made yet.

Majority vote: the most frequent prediction, or `none` for an empty forest.

Ties go to the smallest label under `Ord`. This symbolic helper uses label order; the numeric
classification forest below instead keeps the first tied label in tree order.

## Numeric random forest (spec baseline)

The `Forest` above wraps the symbolic `DecisionTree` from `NN.Spec.Module.DecisionTree`, where
splits are keyed by `String` feature names and an external `decisionFn : String → Bool` decides the
branch. That is handy for examples, but it is not something we can “train” without providing
feature-value semantics.

For a more classical baseline, we also provide a *numeric* random forest built on the
`Spec.DecisionTreeSpec` representation used by `NN/Spec/Models/GradientBoostedTrees.lean`:

- features are indexed by `Nat`
- splits compare a feature value to a threshold
- regression splits minimize the sum of squared errors and classification splits minimize
  weighted Gini impurity
- each tree receives `batch` row draws from the original dataset, with replacement
- `maxFeatures` controls a fresh feature subset at each split; its default is all features

Both samplers use `Spec.Random`'s SplitMix64 generator. Row draws and feature draws have separate
streams, so changing the feature budget does not change a tree's bootstrap sample.

variable {α : Type} [TorchLean.Storage α] [Context α]

/-- Draw `batch` row indices with replacement for one tree.

Each draw chooses from the full original batch. Repeated indices repeat both the observation and
its target during training; rows that were not drawn are absent from that tree. `treeIndex` selects
the tree's stream, and increasing the forest size preserves the samples of its existing prefix.
`hBatch` rules out drawing from an empty dataset.

/-- Select candidate features without replacement for a single node.

A partial Fisher-Yates shuffle chooses `min maxFeatures nFeatures` distinct indices. We sort the
selected indices afterwards so equally good splits keep the lower feature index, independently of
the order in which it was drawn. A zero budget yields no candidates and therefore a leaf.

The root has `nodeIndex = 0`; its children have indices `1` and `2`, with children of node `i`
numbered `2 * i + 1` and `2 * i + 2`. Each node's draw depends only on its seed, tree and position.

Fit a regression forest with seeded row sampling and greedy CART splits.

Each tree receives `batch` paired row/target draws with replacement. At each node, search the
observed thresholds of at most `maxFeatures` sampled features and split only when SSE decreases.
Ties keep the lower feature index, then the first observed threshold in bootstrap row order.

The default seed is `0`, and the default feature budget is the full input width. A smaller budget
samples a fresh subset at every node; `0` gives leaf-only trees. Repeating a call with the same
data, seed and scalar backend reproduces its forest.
