# The real scalar dictionary

`Spec.SpecScalar` is `ℝ`, so every "paper theorem" ultimately runs through the instances here. They
are kept out of `NN.Spec.Core.Context` because `Context ℝ` needs `MathFunctions ℝ`, and that drags
in the whole real-analysis hierarchy; modules working at `Float` or at a general `[Context α]`
should not pay for it.
