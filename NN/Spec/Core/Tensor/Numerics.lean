# Tensor Numerical Algorithms

Reference implementations shared by classical models, graph specifications, and runtime checks:

- matrix minors, determinants, inverses, and power iteration;
- distances between vectors;
- vector normalization.

## Intent / tradeoffs

These definitions prioritize:
- **mathematical clarity**, and
- **shape safety** (via `TorchLean.Tensor`),
over performance.

In particular, `determinantSpec` uses Laplace expansion, which is exponentially expensive and is
only meant for small matrices (for example, 2 x 2 or 3 x 3) and proof-oriented reference code. For
large-scale linear algebra, use the runtime layer with array-backed kernels.

Matrix minor: delete `row` and `col` from an `n × n` matrix, producing an `(n-1) × (n-1)` matrix.

This is used by `determinantSpec` (Laplace expansion) and the adjugate-based inverse below.

/--
Determinant of an `n × n` matrix (spec-level reference implementation).

This uses Laplace expansion (cofactor expansion) along the first row, with special-cased base cases
for `n = 0, 1, 2`. It is mathematically clear but exponentially slow, so it is intended only for
very small `n` and/or proof-oriented reference code.

-- Matrix inverse (implemented using adjugate method)
/--
Matrix inverse via the adjugate formula (spec-level reference implementation).

The result is `none` when the backend comparison `det == 0` succeeds. No conditioning or finiteness
check is performed; on floating-point backends, a nonzero or NaN determinant can therefore produce
nonfinite entries.

PyTorch analogue: `torch.linalg.inv`, with failure represented explicitly by `Option`.

/--
Approximate the leading eigenpair by a caller-selected number of power-iteration steps.

The scalar is the final dot product `v · (matrix v)`, which is the Rayleigh quotient when `v` has
unit norm. Each normalization is attempted only when its computed norm is positive; finite-precision
execution does not guarantee a unit vector. Convergence to a dominant eigenvector requires spectral
assumptions on `matrix` and a suitable initial vector.

/--
L2-normalize a vector with an additive regularizer under the square root.

The denominator is

`sqrt (sumᵢ vector[i] ^ 2 + regularizer)`.

This operation has no zero-norm branch. Callers are responsible for
choosing a regularizer that makes the denominator meaningful in their scalar context. This is the
normalization convention used by several attention and recurrent architectures, where the exact
regularizer is part of the model specification.

/--
Z-score normalization: subtract the mean and divide by the population standard deviation.

When `n = 0`, the empty input is returned before forming a division. Otherwise the mean and
variance divide by the scalar cast `(n : α)` without testing that cast for zero or finiteness.
The final division occurs only when the computed standard deviation is positive; otherwise the
mean-centered vector is returned. These guards do not guarantee finite output on every backend.
