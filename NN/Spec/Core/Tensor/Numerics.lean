# Tensor Numerical Algorithms

Reference implementations shared by classical models, graph specifications, and runtime checks:

- matrix minors, determinants, inverses, and power iteration;
- distances between vectors;
- vector normalization.

## Intent / tradeoffs

These definitions prioritize:
- **mathematical clarity**, and
- **shape safety** (via `TorchLean.Tensor`),
over performance.

In particular, `determinantSpec` uses Laplace expansion, which is exponentially expensive and is
only meant for small matrices (for example, 2 x 2 or 3 x 3) and proof-oriented reference code. For
large-scale linear algebra, use the runtime layer with array-backed kernels.

Matrix minor: delete `row` and `col` from an `n × n` matrix, producing an `(n-1) × (n-1)` matrix.

This is used by `determinantSpec` (Laplace expansion) and the adjugate-based inverse below.

/--
Determinant of an `n × n` matrix (spec-level reference implementation).

This uses Laplace expansion (cofactor expansion) along the first row, with special-cased base cases
for `n = 0, 1, 2`. It is mathematically clear but exponentially slow, so it is intended only for
very small `n` and/or proof-oriented reference code.

-- Matrix inverse (implemented using adjugate method)
/--
Matrix inverse via the adjugate formula (spec-level reference implementation).

The result is `none` when the determinant is zero. Returning an unrelated matrix for a singular
input would make downstream statistical formulas appear defined when they are not.

PyTorch analogue: `torch.linalg.inv`, with failure represented explicitly by `Option`.

Approximate the leading eigenpair by a caller-selected number of power-iteration steps.

The scalar is the final Rayleigh quotient and the tensor is the corresponding normalized iterate.
This definition does not claim to compute a full eigendecomposition. Convergence to a dominant
eigenvector requires the usual spectral assumptions on `matrix` and a suitable initial vector.

the undefined order-zero and negative-order cases.

Divide a vector by its sum when that sum is positive.

If the sum is not positive, this returns the uniform vector. When the input entries are
nonnegative, the positive-sum branch is a probability distribution.

PyTorch analogue: `probs / probs.sum()` (with an explicit zero-sum guard).

/--
L2-normalize a vector with an additive regularizer under the square root.

The denominator is

`sqrt (sumᵢ vector[i] ^ 2 + regularizer)`.

Unlike `normalizeL2Spec`, this operation has no zero-norm branch. Callers are responsible for
choosing a regularizer that makes the denominator meaningful in their scalar context. This is the
normalization convention used by several attention and recurrent architectures, where the exact
regularizer is part of the model specification.

  Tensor.mapSpec (fun value => value / norm) vector

/--
Z-score normalization: subtract the mean and divide by the population standard deviation.

Zero denominators follow the same convention as `normalizeL2Spec` and
`normalizeByPositiveSumSpec`: each denominator is tested before it is used. When `n = 0` there is
nothing to normalize and the empty input is returned without ever forming `sum / n`. When the
standard deviation is `0`, the mean-centered vector is returned.

def normalizeZscoreSpec {n : Nat} (vector : Tensor α [n]) :
  Tensor α [n] :=
  if n = 0 then

        Tensor.scalar (getScalar centered i / std))
    else
      centered
